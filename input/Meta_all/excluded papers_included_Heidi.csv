Central to this objective is the privatisation of lands and the establishment of efficient land markets. To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992. This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU. As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe. The paper provides an international context by examining land administration trends globally. The paper concludes by highlighting the challenges facing the establishment of land administration systems in CEC.","['Accession', 'Cadastre', 'Central European countries (CEC)', 'European Union (EU)', 'Land administration', 'Sustainable development']",yes,no,EU,Yes,no,conceptual,Heidi

The EU Bee Partnership Prototype Platform aims at collecting and exchanging standardised data on pollinator health and other relevant data based on the Bee Hub Proof of concept initially led by BeeLife European Beekeeping Coordination within the framework of the Internet of Bees Project. This new stage of development responds to the main conclusions of the EU Bee Partnership: the need for data standardisation and communication for the benefit of stakeholders and EFSA. The work developed during the prototyping of the platform funded by EFSA has included the design and implementation of data models for the data integrated in the Prototype Platform (https://bee-ppp.eu). A procedure for data and metadata integration has been created and implemented, including validation of the data quality. The platform was enriched with datasets coming from existing projects and public databases. Additionally, several algorithms for exploring the data and extracting ready-to-use information have been proposed in this phase providing examples and avenues for future development. Finally, a reporting feature was added, and some reports were produced, to illustrate the type of information that the analyses of the platform could generate in the future for the benefit of stakeholders, institutions and more sustainable bee health and beekeeping in the EU.","['Algorithms', 'Apiculture', 'Beekeeping', 'Data retrieval', 'Developmental stages', 'Food And Food Industries', 'Partnerships', 'Prototypes', 'Prototyping']",no,no,EU,yes,yes,data,Heidi

For this focus, Member States (MS) are expected to establish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), including a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) as the spatial part of IACS. Different MS have chosen different solutions for their LPIS. Currently, some MS based their IACS/LPIS on data from their Land Administration Systems (LAS), and many others use purpose built special systems for their IACS/LPIS. The issue with these different IACS/LPIS is that they do not have standardized structures; rather, each represents a unique design in each MS, both in the case of LAS based or special systems. In this study, we aim at designing a core data model for those IACS/LPIS based on LAS. For this purpose, we make use of the ongoing standardization initiatives for LAS (Land Administration Domain Model: LADM) and IACS/LPIS (LPIS Core Model: LCM). The data model we propose in this study implies the collaboration between LADM and LCM and includes some extensions. Some basic issues with the collaboration model are discussed within this study: registration of farmers, land use rights and farming limitations, geometry/topology, temporal data management etc. For further explanation of the model structure, sample instance level diagrams illustrating some typical situations are also included.

On the one hand, it gives detailed location information on where to analyze satellite image time series to assess crop condition. On the other hand, it isolates the agriculture component to focus food security monitoring on agriculture and to assess the potential impacts of climate change on agricultural lands. The cropland class is often poorly captured in global land cover products due to its dynamic nature and the large variety of agro-systems. The overall objective was to evaluate the current availability of cropland datasets in order to propose a strategic planning and effort distribution for future cropland mapping activities and, therefore, to maximize their impact. Following a very comprehensive identification and collection of national to global land cover maps, a multi-criteria analysis was designed at the country level to identify the priority areas for cropland mapping. As a result, the analysis highlighted priority regions, such as Western Africa, Ethiopia, Madagascar and Southeast Asia, for the remote sensing community to focus its efforts. A Unified Cropland Layer at 250 m for the year 2014 was produced combining the fittest products. It was assessed using global validation datasets and yields an overall accuracy ranging from 82%-94%. Masking cropland areas with a global forest map reduced the commission errors from 46% down to 26%. Compared to the GLC-Share and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis-International Food Policy Research Institute (IIASA-IFPRI) cropland maps, significant spatial disagreements were found, which might be attributed to discrepancies in the cropland definition. This advocates for a shared definition of cropland, as well as global validation datasets relevant for the agriculture class in order to systematically assess existing and future cropland maps.",['Physics'],yes,no,?,yes,yes,data,Max

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model’s output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m-2·d-1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d-1 and R2 = 0.79). The model’s performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m-2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agricultural production', 'Agronomy', 'Atmospheric models', 'Biogeochemical cycles', 'Biomass', 'Carbon', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Climate change', 'Computer simulation', 'Corn', 'Cover crops', 'Crop growth', 'Crop rotation', 'Crops', 'Data acquisition', 'Efficiency', 'Estimates', 'Fluxes', 'France', 'Gas exchange', 'Growth models', 'Moisture content', 'Performance evaluation', 'Physics', 'Productivity', 'Remote sensing', 'Retention capacity', 'Root-mean-square errors', 'Sensitivity analysis', 'Simulation', 'Soil properties', 'Soil water', 'Soils', 'Sunflowers', 'Water budget', 'Water demand', 'Water resources', 'Water stress', 'Wheat', 'Winter', 'Yield', 'carbon budget', 'crop modeling', 'remote sensing', 'soil properties', 'water budget']",no,no,FR,yes,yes,data,Andreas

The root of the problem is that farmers are not paid for achieving a desired environmental benefit, but compensated for their costs of management. There is growing interest in formulating result-based economic incentives. By paying for an environmental benefit and allowing flexibility in how to achieve it, farmers are given an incentive to exploit their comparative advantages for achieving a desired environmental benefit cost-effectively. However, the feasibility and relative effectiveness of result-based payments for reducing agricultural pollution is contentious. In this study, we designed and evaluated a result-based payment scheme for nonpoint-source pollution abatement from arable land. In a case study in southern Sweden, the cost-effectiveness of the new scheme was compared with that of an existing action-based scheme for vegetated buffer strips to prevent the pollutant, particulate phosphorus, from reaching water resources. The results suggest that result-based payment schemes based on modeled outcomes of pollution abatement are feasible and will considerably improve cost-effectiveness compared to action-based schemes, by relocating buffer strips to where they are more effective and not simply where they have the lowest costs for farmers.","['Agri-environmental scheme', 'Buffer strip', 'Cost-effective', 'Nonpoint source pollution', 'Nutrient runoff', 'Performance based policy']",no,no,SE,yes,yes,data,Andreas

The benefit of the fusion of optical and radar data, which supports the application of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, is also evident.

Legitimacy of support provided to farmers is monitored using the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), with land cover identification performed by visual image interpretation. While the geometric orthoimage quality required for correct interpretation is well understood, little is known about the photometric quality needed for LPIS applications. This paper analyzes the orthoimage quality characteristics chosen by authors as being most suitable for visual identification of agricultural fields. We designed a survey to assess users_ preferred brightness and contrast ranges for orthoimages used for LPIS purposes. Survey questions also tested the influence of a background color on the preferred orthoimage brightness and contrast, the preferred orthoimage format and color composite, assessments of orthoimages with shadowed areas, appreciation of image enhancements and, finally, consistency of individuals_ preferred brightness and contrast settings across multiple sample images. We find that image appreciation is stable at the individual level, but preferences vary across respondents. We therefore recommend that LPIS operators be enabled to personalize photometric settings, such as brightness and contrast values, and to choose the displayed band combination from at least four spectral bands.",['orthoimage quality assessment ; photometric qualit'],yes,?,?,yes,yes,data,Max

The aquifer is also used intensively by agriculture. Common agricultural management practices are the main source for diffuse nitrogen leaching and high groundwater nitrate concentrations. To safeguard the coexisting use of these two important resources, lysimeters are operated at the agricultural test site Wagna, Austria, and the influence of two beneficial management practices – low nitrogen input and organic farming – on nitrogen leaching towards groundwater is investigated. The technical lysimeter design as presented here consists of: (1) high-resolution weighing cells, (2) a suction controlled lower boundary condition for sucking off seepage water, thus emulating undisturbed field conditions, (3) comparative soil temperature, water content and matrix potential measurements inside and outside the lysimeter at different depths, (4) an installation of the lysimeters directly into test plots and (5) a removable upper lysimeter ring enabling machinery soil tillage. Our results indicate that oasis effects or fringe effects of the lysimeter cylinder on unsaturated water flow did not occur. Another lysimeter cultivated with lawn is operated for observing grass-reference evapotranspiration, which resulted in good agreement with calculated grass-reference evapotranspiration according to the FAO-Penman–Monteith method. We conclude that lysimeters installed at Wagna test site did not show any fringe effects and, thus, are appropriate tools for measuring water balance elements and nitrogen leaching of arable and grass land at point scale. Furthermore, our results for the period of 2005 to 2011 show that beneficial management practices reduced nitrate leaching and, hence, may allow for a sustainable coexistence of drinking water supply and agriculture in the Murtal aquifer.","['Evapotranspiration', 'Grass-reference evapotranspiration', 'Low nitrogen input farming', 'Nitrogen/nitrate leaching', 'Organic farming', 'weighable, monolithic lysimeter']",no,no,AT,yes,yes,data,Max
