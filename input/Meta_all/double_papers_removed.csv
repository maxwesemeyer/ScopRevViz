National and global emission inventories are known to have difficulty representing the large spatial and temporal variability inherent to atmospheric NH3. In this study, we compare NH3 emissions in France during spring 2011 from one reference inventory, the TNO inventory, and two alternative inventories that account in different manners for both the spatial and temporal variabilities of the emissions: (i) the NH3SAT satellite-derived inventory based on IASI NH3 columns and (ii) the CADASTRE-CIT inventory that combinesNH3 emissions due to nitrogen fertilization calculated with the mechanistic model VOLT'AIR on the database of the CADASTRE_NH3 framework and other source emissions from the CITEPA. The total spring budgets, from March to May 2011, at the national level are higher when calculated with both alternative inventories than with the reference, the difference being more marked with CADASTRE-CIT. NH3SAT and CADASTRE-CIT inventories both yield to large NH3 spring emissions due to fertilization on soils with high pH in the northeastern part of France (65 and 135 ktNH3, respectively, vs. 48 ktNH3 for TNO-GEN), while soil properties are not accounted for by the TNO-GEN methodology. For the other parts of France, the differences are smaller. The timing of fertilization and associated ammonia emissions is closely related to the nitrogen requirements and hence the phenological stage of the crops, and therefore to the crop year's specific weather conditions. Maximum emissions are observed in March for 2011 for some regions for both alternative inventories, while April is the period with maximum emissions for the reference inventory regardless of the region or the year. Comparing the inventories at finer temporal resolutions, typically at daily scale, large differences are found. The convergence of alternative, independent and complementary methods on the spatiotemporal representation of the spring NH3 emissions, particularly over areas where the contribution of mineral fertilizer spreading to the spring budget is strong, encourages further developments in both prospective complementary directions, as this will help improve national NH3 emission inventories.","['Agricultural management', 'Agriculture', 'Air pollution', 'Ammonia', 'Ammonia emissions', 'Atmospheric particulate matter', 'Atmospheric particulates', 'Biological fertilization', 'Budgets', 'Convergence', 'Emission', 'Emission inventories', 'Emissions', 'Fertilization', 'Fertilizers', 'France', 'Livestock', 'Meteorology', 'Nitrogen', 'Particulate emissions', 'Particulate matter', 'Representations', 'Sediment properties', 'Soil fertility', 'Soil properties', 'Spring', 'Suspended particulate matter', 'Temporal variability', 'Temporal variations', 'Weather', 'Weather conditions']",yes,yes,FR,Yes,no,,Heidi

Conversion of grassland to arable land is accompanied by a diminution of these functions. Various developments have led to increased pressure on the EU grassland area. With cross compliance, the EU sets minimum standards for the protection of the ratio of permanent grassland. However, this requirement alone does not ensure the preservation of grassland on sensitive sites, such as water or nature conservation areas or land on organic soils or on steep hills.This paper deals with land use changes between grassland and arable land. For this purpose we analyse data of the EU's Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) from four German federal states. The described methodology allows to identify gross changes of land use and to distinguish between conversion of permanent grassland and ""loss"" due to ""deactivation"" at a highly disaggregated level. Merging IACS-data with further spatially explicit data provides a picture of land use transitions in ecologically sensitive areas and enables conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of protection measures.

Predicting the effects of a range of possible LUCCs helps local authorities choose policies that can help to mitigate the risks to which local populations are exposed. In this article we build scenarios for changes in farming systems, with a 2015 horizon and with 2007 as the initial situation. These scenarios are assessed through combined biophysical and economic approaches. Two scenarios for the disappearance of dairy farming are chosen. One scenario has no public-action program (StopMilk), while the other one has a program based on the funding of best management practices (StopMilk-E). These scenarios are assessed at the small watershed scale (7km2) in terms of both changes in farming systems and effects on runoff (use of the STREAM model). Finally, the economic evaluation of additional costs of StopMilk-E is extrapolated at the level of the Austreberthe watershed syndicate (214km2), using the French Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) with a spatially referenced database of cropping plans. StopMilk leads to a significant increase in runoff whereas the local public-action program proposed under StopMilk-E reduces runoff to below the 2007 level. The Austreberthe watershed residentsâ willingness to pay for a 15-year program is around â395,000/year, which is not sufficient to balance the cost of the modified farming practices (â640,000/year over the first 3 years). Funding of the practices would require either subsidies from a higher level (Europe), borrowing by the community, and/or a more selective approach in the type and the location of farming practices to be funded. The method used for calculating costs at the watershed syndicate level shows the huge potential of new databases like LPIS (available in France since 2006) for the assessment of environmental issues.","['France', 'agricultural runoff', 'at-risk population', 'best ma', 'best management practices', 'dairy farming', 'databases', 'economic analysis', 'environmental assessment', 'farming systems', 'funding', 'issues and policy', 'land use', 'models', 'prediction', 'risk', 'streams', 'subsidies', 'watersheds', 'willingness to pay']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Henning

Recent works have shown the capability of Sentinel-2 to predict SOC content over temperate agroecosystems characterized with annual crops. However, because spectral models are only applicable on bare soils, the mapping of SOC is often obtained on limited areas. A possible improvement for increasing the number of pixels on which SOC can be retrieved by inverting bare soil reflectance spectra, consists of using optical images acquired at several dates. This study compares different approaches of Sentinel–2 images temporal mosaicking to produce a composite multi-date bare soil image for predicting SOC content over agricultural topsoils. A first approach for temporal mosaicking was based on a per-pixel selection and was driven by soil surface characteristics: bare soil or dry bare soil with/without removing dry vegetation. A second approach for creating composite images was based on a per-date selection and driven either by the models performance from single-date, or by average soil surface indicators of bare soil or dry bare soil. To characterize soil surface, Sentinel-1 (S1)-derived soil moisture and/or spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), bare soil index (BSI) and a soil surface moisture index (S2WI) were used either separately or in combination. This study highlighted the following results: i) none of the temporal mosaic images improved model performance for SOC prediction compared to the best single-date image; ii) of the per-pixel approaches, temporal mosaics driven by the S1-derived moisture content, and to a lesser extent, by NBR2 index, outperformed the mosaic driven by the BSI index but they did not increase the bare soil area predicted; iii) of the per-date approaches, the best trade-off between predicted area and model performance was achieved from the temporal mosaic driven by the S1-derived moisture content (R2 ~ 0.5, RPD ~ 1.4, RMSE ~ 3.7 g.kg-1) which enabled to more than double (*2.44) the predicted area. This study suggests that a number of bare soil mosaics based on several indicators (moisture, bare soil, roughness…), preferably in combination, might maintain acceptable accuracies for SOC prediction whilst extending over larger areas than single-date images.","['Croplands', 'Sentinel-2', 'Soil moisture', 'Soil organic carbon', 'Temporal mosaic']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Henning

As a data base I used the single farm data of the farm censuses 1990, 1995 and 1999, partly complemented by the INVEKOS data pool and other data sources such as regional unemployment and income statistics. For the estimation I used a multivariate logistic regression model. First, it was possible to show that the probability of giving up farming declined particularly with participation in the Austrian environmental program OPUL, the total farm income and the size of direct payments (OPUL and program for mountain farmers). Furthermore, small and medium forest areas seem to improve the chance for farm survival, whereas farms with large forest areas are given up more frequently. In addition to economic factors, family conditions and personal properties of farm holders play an important role. For example, farm holders without children have a lower probability of surviving than farm holders with children, female farm holders give up more easily than male ones, and elder farm holders, as expected, more easily than young ones. Finally, I tested several regional factors, showing that the proximity to cities was particularly influential in increasing the chance of remaining in the sector.

This is the first report on post-restoration development of the soil seed reserve in a high-alpine site. Unless otherwise specified, the data presented below refer to means+/-standard error values.The density of the germinable fraction of the seed reserve recorded in the autumn samples averaged 916+/-210 seeds per m(2) in the plots RPF; the corresponding value in the plots RPG was lower (611+/-333 seeds per m(2)). After the spring snowmelt in the following year a diminished density (698+/-270 seeds per m(2)) was observed in the plots RPE but in the plots RPG a considerable increase (3580+/-1701 seeds per m(2)) was recorded. The differences between the two plot groups and between sampling seasons were not statistically significant because of the large variance.In the autumn samples, seven species were identified among the retrieved seedlings, and two further species were registered in the small un-germinated fraction. The spring samples included only four identified species within the germinable fraction; no further species were determined among many dormant seeds. The alpha-diversity studies revealed some salient features: (1) the soil seed reserve included mostly immigrant species, and only few species used in the restoration were represented; (2) compared to the standing vegetation, much fewer species occurred in the soil samples: (3) the relative frequency of species in the seed reserve did not correspond to the species frequency in the plant cover of the plots.Considered both in the terms of diaspore accumulation and increase of alpha-diversity, the soil seed reserve developed within only ca 10 years after restoration represents an important symptom of active plant population processes occurring in the restoration plots.

The aquifer is also used intensively by agriculture. Common agricultural management practices are the main source for diffuse nitrogen leaching and high groundwater nitrate concentrations. To safeguard the coexisting use of these two important resources, lysimeters are operated at the agricultural test site Wagna, Austria, and the influence of two beneficial management practices – low nitrogen input and organic farming – on nitrogen leaching towards groundwater is investigated. The technical lysimeter design as presented here consists of: (1) high-resolution weighing cells, (2) a suction controlled lower boundary condition for sucking off seepage water, thus emulating undisturbed field conditions, (3) comparative soil temperature, water content and matrix potential measurements inside and outside the lysimeter at different depths, (4) an installation of the lysimeters directly into test plots and (5) a removable upper lysimeter ring enabling machinery soil tillage. Our results indicate that oasis effects or fringe effects of the lysimeter cylinder on unsaturated water flow did not occur. Another lysimeter cultivated with lawn is operated for observing grass-reference evapotranspiration, which resulted in good agreement with calculated grass-reference evapotranspiration according to the FAO-Penman–Monteith method. We conclude that lysimeters installed at Wagna test site did not show any fringe effects and, thus, are appropriate tools for measuring water balance elements and nitrogen leaching of arable and grass land at point scale. Furthermore, our results for the period of 2005 to 2011 show that beneficial management practices reduced nitrate leaching and, hence, may allow for a sustainable coexistence of drinking water supply and agriculture in the Murtal aquifer.","['Evapotranspiration', 'Grass-reference evapotranspiration', 'Low nitrogen input farming', 'Nitrogen/nitrate leaching', 'Organic farming', 'weighable, monolithic lysimeter']",no,no,AT,yes,yes,dataset,Saskia

Landscape pattern indices (LPIs) are tools appropriate for analyzing landscape spatial patterns. LPIs are often derived from raster land cover maps that are extracted from remotely sensed data through hard classification. However, pixel-based hard classification methods suffer from the mixed pixel problem (in which pixels contain more than one land cover class), making for inaccurate classification maps and LPIs. In addition, LPIs generated by hard classification methods are characterized by grain sizes (the sampling unit sizes) that limit the derived landscape pattern to a certain scale. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) models can enable fine-scale estimation of the spatial patterns of land cover classes without requiring additional data; hence, this is an appropriate downscaling method for land cover mapping. The fraction images generated by soft classification estimate the area proportion of each land cover class within each pixel, and using these images as input enables SPM models to alleviate the mixed pixel problem. At the same time, by transforming fraction images into a finer-scaled hard classification map, SPM models can minimize the influence of grain size on LPIs calculation. In this research, simulated landscape thematic patterns that can provide different landscape spatial patterns, eight commonly used LPIs and a SPM model that maximizes the spatial dependence between neighbouring sub-pixels were applied to assess the efficiency of deriving LPIs from sub-pixel model maps. Results showed that the SPM model can more precisely characterize landscape patterns than hard classification methods can. Landscape fragmentation, class abundance, the uncertainty in SPM, and the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data influenced LPIs derived from sub-pixel maps. The largest patch index, landscape division, and patch cohesion derived from remotely sensed data with different spatial resolutions through the SPM model were suitable for inter-comparison, whereas the patch density, mean patch area, edge density, landscape shape index, and area-weighted mean shape index derived from the sub-pixel maps were sensitive to the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data.",['cohesion ; land cover ; landscape management ; lan'],no,no,?,yes,yes,dataset,Stefan

We investigated how availability of floral resources and potentially resource‐rich habitats surrounding nests affected nest provisioning and reproduction in the solitary polylectic bee Osmia bicornis. The study was performed in 18 landscape sectors dominated by agriculture, but varying in agricultural intensity in terms of proportion of organic crop fields and seminatural permanent pastures. Pasture‐rich sectors contained more oak (Quercus robur), which pollen analysis showed to be favored forage in early season. More oaks ≤100 m from nests led to higher proportions of oak pollen in nest provisions and increased speed of nest construction in early season, but this effect tapered off as flowering decreased. Late‐season pollen foraging was dominated by buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), common in various noncrop habitats. Foraging trips were longer with more oaks and increased further through the season. The opposite was found for buttercup. Oak and buttercup interacted to explain the number of offspring; buttercup had a positive effect only when the number of oaks was above the mean for the studied sectors. The results show that quality of complex and pasture‐rich landscapes for O. bicornis depends on preserving existing and generating new oak trees. Lignose plants are key early‐season forage resources in agricultural landscapes. Increasing habitat heterogeneity with trees and shrubs and promoting suitable late‐flowering forbs can benefit O. bicornis and other wild bees active in spring and early summer, something which existing agri‐environment schemes seldom target.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural resources', 'Bees', 'Biology', 'Crop fields', 'Crops', 'Flowering', 'Foraging habitats', 'Forbs', 'Habitats', 'Landscape', 'Landscape preservation', 'Nest provisioning', 'Nesting', 'Nests', 'Oak', 'Offspring', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Pasture', 'Plants (botany)', 'Pollen', 'Pollination', 'Provisioning', 'Quercus robur', 'Ranunculus', 'Reproduction', 'Shrubs', 'Trees', 'agri‐environment schemes', 'central‐place forager', 'farmland biodiversity', 'organic farming', 'pollen foraging', 'pollinator', 'red mason bee']",yes,yes,SE,Yes,no,,Stefan

Apart from the ecological evaluation of agricultural enterprises and agrarian policy measures, indicators are also used in environmental reporting and evaluation as well as in planning or simulation models in administrative and scientific fields. Already for longer period of time, indicators have been used as assessment criteria in landscape planning to support decisions regarding land use. Due to the standards the EU commission requires from the member states in this regard, the application of indicators to assess the effects of agri-environment programs have gained prominence. The EU requires proof of the achievement of the promotion aims such as soil (erosion, nutrients, plant-protective agents), water, bio-diversity and landscape (EU/VO 12004/00). This commitment can be met by means of a functioning environmental reporting. However, only an insufficient number of suitable indicators exist in the fields of bio-diversity and landscape. In a bottom-up approach, control systems to assess ecological farming achieved on an operational level for a future development were recently developed. Here, a future development is seen in the alignment referring to results or goals, respectively, and in the regionalisation. The article gives an overview of the indicator application on different spatial levels and for different purposes.","['Agri-environment program', 'Application of indicators', 'Farm assessment', 'Landscape planning', 'Monitoring']",no,no,?,yes,yes,no IACS data used,Andreas

In a case study model calculations were used to evaluate different options of land use, agricultural and water management to reduce nitrogen immissions and enhance water and nutrient retardation in the Elbe river basin. The model scenarios consider measures which are recommended to reduce nitrogen pollution like organic farming, conversion of arable land into pasture, extensivation of grassland production and set aside. Additionally the re-wetting of formerly drained areas by water management is considered where applicable. Although there are distinct differences in nitrogen leaching between the different agricultural land use and management options, the regional effects of the scenarios on the emissions from the root zone are only fair (max. 13%) because of their limited extent of application. But the targeted application of the measures in zones of high river impact risk derived from groundwater residence times and decay calculations lead to a distinct reduction of the nitrogen input into the river flow system. The combination of water management and extensivation of agricultural production can achieve a reduction of 22% (4.400 t/a) of the nitrogen immissions originated from agriculture. Areas with a high reduction potential for nitrogen immission can be identified. This can be a relevant information for the development of measure programs within the water framework directive.","['Agricultural production systems', 'Nitrogen leaching', 'River basin management', 'River impact', 'Water framework directive']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

This paper focuses on the descriptive analysis of the modifications of this policy change. The analysis of the German Central IACS database (ZID) shows that the current face value and distribution of the payment entitlements largely reflects the historical evolution of German farm structures. While in the old federal states the distribution of payment entitlements differs between regions with intensive and extensive agriculture, the newly-formed states show a more homogenous distribution of the face values. The heterogeneity of payment entitlements is already apparent at the lowest level of spatial aggregation (municipality) in all trade regions. In Germany, the transition to the regional model in 2013 will lead to a substantial redistribution of the agricultural transfer payments of the first pillar. Furthermore, analyses of the ZID shows that trade with payment entitlements per se, that is to say trade without simultaneous trade of land, seldom occurs. The analysis of an expert survey adds up to trading prices of single payments which are markedly lower than the net present value. A possible reason Could be that not all the payment entitlements are activated, which is an indication of a surplus of single payments.

Traditional field inspection (on-the-spot checks) and computer-aided photointerpretation (CAPI) carried out by each PA over a sample of 5% of the applicants are being replaced by a 100% sample Copernicus satellite-based system (checks by monitoring, CbM). This new approach will be an integral part of the Area Monitoring System that will be part of the Integrated Administrative Control System (IACS) in the post-2020 CAP. Among all the aid schemes having to be analyzed, there are some specific aids in which the detection of irrigation of certain crops can result in a no-compliance resolution. Apart from that, the knowledge of the truly irrigated area in each campaign has always been data of great interest in irrigation planning, crop yield statistics, and water management, and now more than ever. Although several sources of information exist, there is no consensual methodology for estimating the actual irrigated area. The objective of this study is to propose a methodological approach based mainly on Copernicus Sentinel and IACS data not only to detect the surface of herbaceous crops that have been actually irrigated but also to derive a product suitable to be incorporated into the CAP monitoring process system. This methodology is already being used operationally during the ongoing campaign 2020 by Castile and Leon PA.

These typologies have been criticised, however, for not fully capturing true farmer behaviour, and are consequently limited for supporting policy formulation. We present a method that develops a typology, using a social survey approach based on how farmers perceive their environment (e.g. birds and agri-environmental schemes). We then apply time-series census data on past farm strategies (i.e. land use allocation, management style and participation into agri-environmental schemes) to refine these typologies. Consequently, this offers an approach to improving the profiling of farmer types, and strengthens the validity of input into future agricultural policies. While the social survey highlights a certain degree of awareness towards birds with respect to farmer types, the analysis of past farm strategies indicated that farmers did not entirely follow their stated objectives. External factors such as input and output price signals and subsidy levels had a stronger influence on their strategies rather than stated environmental and social issues. Consequently, the refining of farmer types using this approach would aid the design of policy instruments, which integrate ecological issues within planning.","['Agri-environmental schemes', 'Agricultural census data', 'CAP', 'Cluster analysis', 'Farm strategy', 'Farmer typology']",?,?,Scotland,yes,yes,study area is in Scotland,Andreas
