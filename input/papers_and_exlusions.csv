This study gives an insight on the way German dairies think about and act in such topics by using a standardized survey method. The survey revealed little to no linkage between the size of dairies and their interest in conservation issues on grassland and very little consideration of extensive grasslands. Dairies are divided over questions of governance for a more sustainable milk market and on the nature of their relationships with farmers. There is evidence that the German dairy industry is willing to contribute to a more sustainable and more robust milk market, but the enterprises mostly regard other market actors as more important. According to this survey, consumers will tend to opt for more sustainable milk products in future and there are possibilities to raise the willingness to pay.","['Agricultural management', 'Agricultural production', 'Agriculture', 'Conservation', 'Consumers', 'Dairies', 'Dairy cattle', 'Dairy farms', 'Dairy industry', 'Diaries', 'Environmental Studies', 'Feeds', 'Germany', 'Grassland management', 'Grasslands', 'Hypotheses', 'Milk', 'Milk production', 'Milk products', 'Prices', 'Product lines', 'Questionnaires', 'Resource conservation', 'Resource management', 'Subsidies', 'Surveys', 'Sustainability', 'climate protection', 'dairy farmer', 'dairy goods', 'dairy industry', 'food system', 'grassland', 'grassland conservation', 'survey']",no,no,DE,yes,yes,dataset,Franziska

We investigated this impact for the western region of Brittany, France, in 2007. To do so, we regressed a set of performance indicators on a set of fragmentation descriptors. The performance indicators (production costs, yields, revenue, profitability, technical and scale efficiency) were calculated at the farm level using Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data, while the fragmentation descriptors were calculated at the municipality level using data from the cartographic field pattern registry (RPG). The various fragmentation descriptors enabled us to account for not only the traditional number and average size of plots, but also their geographical scattering. We found that farms experienced higher costs of production, lower crop yields and lower profitability where land fragmentation (LF) was more pronounced. Total technical efficiency was not found to be significantly related to any of the municipality LF descriptors used, while scale efficiency was lower where the average distance to the nearest neighbouring plot was greater. Pure technical efficiency was found to be negatively related to the average number of plots in the municipality, with the unexpected result that it was also positively related to the average distance to the nearest neighbouring plot. By simulating the impact of hypothetical consolidation programmes on average pre-tax profits and wheat yield, we also showed that the marginal benefits of reducing fragmentation may differ with respect to the improved LF dimension and the performance indicator considered. Our analysis therefore shows that the measures of land fragmentation usually used in the literature do not reveal the full set of significant relationships with farm performance and that, in particular, measures accounting for distance should be considered more systematically.","['D24', 'Farm Management', 'France.', 'Land Economics/Use', 'Q12', 'Q15', 'agricultural land fragmentation', 'cartographic field pattern registry', 'farm performance']",yes,yes,FR,yes,yes,duplicate,Franziska

The model was validated by a 40-fold cross validation procedure and applied to Austrian cropland on a spatial resolution of 1 km. Results show that increased probabilities of WCR occurrence and abundance are associated with higher maize shares in crop rotations combined with a positive influence of higher winter temperatures and summer precipitation.

However, the functional heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes, taking into account the different resources that habitat patches can provide to species, has rarely been studied. In this study, we explored the effect of landscape-scale nest availability provided by permanent grasslands on wild bee communities. Wild bees were sampled in 43 cereal fields in south-western France differing in the surrounding proportion of permanent grasslands. Using remote sensing tools, we measured two parameters of grassland structure known to locally influence bee nest density (slope and proportion of sparse vegetation). We found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands was the factor that most positively influenced bee richness, abundance and trait distribution in bee communities. We also found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands had a better predictive power of bee community structure than the proportion of permanent grasslands. Ground-nesting species, species with high dispersal capacities and species with a generalist diet were positively affected by the availability of sloped ground in the surrounding permanent grasslands. Only bee species with specialized flower requirements responded positively to the proportion of sparse vegetation in grasslands. Our results suggest that landscape-scale availability of nesting resources provided by grasslands affects bee communities in agricultural landscapes and can help sustain functionally diverse bee assemblages.

The man-origin sub-system reached up to 35% of the SDS functioning during heavy rainfalls, whereas the sub-system composed of incisions/concavities conditioned by micro-relief reached up to 24% of this SDS. Smaller lateral valleys included to the SDS during heavy rainfalls constitute up to 37% of the SDS. The permanent streams constitute the remaining part of the SDS.

In agricultural landscapes, the composition and configuration of cultivated fields and their multi-year dynamics should be considered. But the habitat-matrix paradigm in landscape ecology has resulted in little consideration of cropped areas.              Objectives              The main objective of our study was to determine the influences of spatial and multi-year temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic on carabid beetle assemblages of agricultural landscapes.              Methods              Carabids were sampled in 40 cereal fields in western France, and their species richness, total abundance and abundance of species groups with different dispersal abilities were measured. For each sampling site, we computed different metrics that characterized crop mosaic spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We quantified relationships between carabid assemblages and heterogeneity metrics and tested their significance.              Results              Total carabid abundance increased with increase in temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic. However, all species were not influenced in the same way by spatial and temporal heterogeneity metrics. Some species with high dispersal power such as Trechus quadristriatus were more abundant in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, whereas the abundance of less mobile species such as Poecilus cupreus were only positively influenced by temporal crop dynamics.              Conclusions              Our results suggest that both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the crop mosaic affects farmland biodiversity, at least for species that use crops during their life cycle or disperse through fields.

It is, therefore, of importance to understand the limits above which these data still guarantee a meaningful outcome. This paper proposes a new method to quantify and specify restrictions of the Sentinel-2 imagery in the context of checks by monitoring, a newly introduced control approach within the European Common Agriculture Policy framework. The method consists of a comparison of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series constructed from data of different spatial resolution to estimate the performance and limits of the coarser one. Using similarity assessment of Sentinel-2 (10 m pixel size) and PlanetScope (3 m pixel size) NDVI time series, it was estimated that for 10% out of 867 fields less than 0.5 ha in size, Sentinel-2 data did not provide reliable evidence of the activity or state of the agriculture field over a given timeframe. Statistical analysis revealed that the number of clean or full pixels and the proportion of pixels lost after an application of a 5-m (1/2 pixel) negative buffer are the geospatial parameters of the field that have the highest influence on the ability of the Sentinel-2 data to qualify the field’s state in time. We specified the following limiting criteria: at least 8 full pixels inside a border and less than 60% of pixels lost. It was concluded that compliance with the criteria still assures a high level of extracted information reliability. Our research proved the promising potential, which was higher than anticipated, of Sentinel-2 data for the continuous state assessment of small fields.

Secondly, in all cases but one, the effect of the various LF descriptors on performance indicators conform to expectations, that is to say LF increases production costs and decreases yields, revenue, profitability and efficiency. Thirdly, with a simple simulation we have shown that the benefits from reducing fragmentation may differ with respect to the improved LF dimension and the performance indicator considered.

In order to understand general habitat preferences we modelled grey partridge and common pheasant densities over the entire range of Lower Saxony. Spatially explicit developments in bird densities were modelled using spatially explicit trends of crop cultivation. Pheasant and grey partridge densities counted annually by over 8000 hunting district holders over 10 years in a range of 3.7 Mio ha constitute a unique dataset (wildlife survey of Lower Saxony). Data on main landscape groups, functional groups of agricultural crops (consisting of 9.5 million fields compiled by the Integrated Administration and Control System) and landscape features were aggregated to 420 municipalities. To model linear 8 or 10 year population trends (for common pheasant and grey partridge respectively) we use rho correlation coefficients of densities, but also rho coefficients of agricultural crops. RESULTS: All models confirm a dramatic decline in population densities. The habitat model for the grey partridge shows avoidance of municipalities with a high proportion of woodland and water areas, but a preference for areas with a high proportion of winter grains and high crop diversity. The trend model confirms these findings with a linear positive effect of diversity on grey partridge population development. Similarly, the pheasant avoids wooded areas but showed some preference for municipalities with open water. The effect of maize was found to be positive at medium densities, but negative at very high proportions. Winter grains, landscape features and high crop diversity are favorable. The positive effect of winter grains and higher crop diversity is also supported by the trend model. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the strong importance of diverse crop cultivation. Most incentives favor the cultivation of specific crops, which results in large areas of monocultures.

These databases describe field geometry and landcover, and provide information on farm characteristics. LPIS data could therefore be used to describe agricultural landscape dynamics, but are seldom put to this purpose by scientists and local stakeholders because it requires the use of GIS software and programming skills. The objective of this paper is thus to present RPG Explorer, a new tool that we developed to analyze agricultural landscape dynamics with LPIS data. RPG Explorer doesn_t require any specific skills in GIS and programming allowing non specialist to deal with complex data.RPG Explorer includes a first module which computes the changes in crop proportions and farm characteristics (numbers of farm, farm area, farm type). A second module computes crop sequences on each farmer block of LPIS data. We also included a crop rotation model in a third module.We illustrated the use of RPG Explorer for two example neighboring catchments located in western France, the Vivier catchment (16,000ha) and the Courance catchment (15,000ha). For example, RPG Explorer easily revealed the evolution of crop proportions, such as the increase of temporary grasslands in the Courance catchment (from 7.2% of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) in 2007 to 11.7% in 2013). The number of farms was also shown to vary a lot: from 230 in 2007 to 207 in 2013 for the Vivier catchment, with a subsequent increase of their mean UAA (from 101ha to 119ha). RPG Explorer also showed that more than half of the Vivier catchment UAA (59%) was occupied by only 50 farms in 2013. Concerning crop sequences, the sunflower _ winter wheat sequence was the most frequent 2-year sequence in both catchments, but some differences appeared with for example, a higher proportion of winter wheat _ winter wheat sequence in the Courance catchment (7.2% against 3.6%). Crop rotation modeling indicated that the rapeseed _ winter wheat _ sunflower _ winter wheat, sunflower _ winter wheat and maize monoculture were the three main crop rotations.Finally, these examples illustrate well the ability for scientist and local stakeholders to easily describe some major agricultural landscape dynamics with RPG Explorer.","['agricultural subsidies', 'computer software', 'corn']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Franziska

In order to identify key mechanisms for GHG mitigation on farms, many studies use mass flow simulation or optimization models. However, by assuming “best practice” and not accounting for “real farm practices”, these models cannot predict variability between farms. In contrast, studies that include variability between farms can identify determinants that are important factors to reduce GHG emissions. From a farmer's perspective, it is often crucial that these mechanisms also increase farm profitability. The objectives of this article are (1) to explore factors that jointly affect GHG emissions and profitability of dairy farms and, (2) to assess if these factors cause synergies or trade-offs to simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and increase profitability. To assess variability between farms, we utilize detailed site- or farm-specific input variables for a large number of farms. To this end, we combined a detailed high quality dataset of 92 farms for the year 2013 in Bavaria, Germany. In relation to GHG emissions, we collected emission factors from national and international life cycle analysis databases, and applied national and site-specific GHG emission models. Our global sensitivity analysis identified five factors affecting GHG emissions per kg of fat and protein corrected milk in the following order of relative importance (i.e. proportion of farm variability explained): feed use efficiency (26%), weighted nitrogen balance (23%), site specific nitrogen emission factor (15%), milk yield (13%), and replacement rate (8%). Of these five factors, feed use efficiency and milk yield were also relatively important factors for profitability. However, milk yield is strongly interlinked with beef output, an important by-product of our sample dairy farms, and thus needs special attention when defining effective GHG reduction targets. Site-specific nitrogen emission factors cannot be influenced directly by farmers. This leaves three main determinants for farm variability between farms of GHG emissions i.e. on field nitrogen use efficiency, feed use efficiency and replacement rate. Since feed use efficiency was also identified as an important factor increasing profitability, this could be addressed by advisory services assessing synergies between profitability and GHG emissions. On field nitrogen use efficiency and replacement rate were not identified as an important factor affecting profitability and thus may be addressed by additional incentives for farmers, advisory service, or stricter regulations.","['Dairy farms', 'GHG emissions', 'Global sensitivity analysis', 'Profitability', 'Synergies', 'Trade-offs']",yes,yes,GE,yes,no,,Franziska

We monitored seed predation on four common weed species and carabid communities in 28 winter-cereals fields during five consecutive weeks in spring 2010. These fields were situated in contrasted landscape contexts and varied in terms of intensity of pesticide treatments and soil tillage regimes. Weed seed predation was strongly and positively related to the Shannon diversity of (strictly) granivorous carabids and to the activity–density of omnivorous carabids but negatively to the richness of omnivorous carabids. Weed seed predation and granivore diversity were positively related to landscape diversity and the proportion cover of temporary grassland within a 1000m radius around focal fields and were negatively affected by the intensity of local pesticide treatments. No-till systems sheltered higher diversity of granivorous carabids but did not show higher seed predation rates. We showed that landscape composition factors had a higher relative influence than local practices factors on weed seed predation service. Consequently, weed management strategies should not only consider the management of single fields but also the surrounding landscape to preserve carabid biodiversity and enhance weed seed predation service. Zusammenfassung Die Biodiversität von Agrarflächen und die mit ihr assoziierten Ökosystemdienstleistungen werden von landwirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten auf mehreren räumlichen Skalen beeinflusst. Unter diesen Dienstleistungen hat die Regulierung von Unkräutern durch wirbellose Samenfresser in letzter Zeit viel Aufmerksamkeit erfahren, aber wenig ist über die relativen Effekte von lokaler Bewirtschaftung und dem Landschaftskontext der Felder auf diesen Prozess bekannt. Wir untersuchten die Granivorie an vier gemeinen Unkrautarten und die Carabidengemeinschaften auf 28 Feldern für fünf aufeinanderfolgende Wochen im Frühjahr 2010. Diese Felder befanden sich in unterschiedlichen Landschaftskontexten und unterschieden sich in Bezug auf Pestizideinsatz und Bodenbearbeitung. Der Fraß an Unkrautsamen war stark positiv mit der Shannon-Diversität der strikt granivoren Carabiden und mit der Aktivitätsdichte der omnivoren Carabiden verknüpft, aber negativ mit der Artenzahl der omnivoren Carabiden. Granivorie und die Diversität der Granivoren waren positiv mit der Landschaftsdiversität und dem Flächenanteil von temporärem Grasland innerhalb eines 1000-m-Radius um das Zielfeld verbunden. Beide Variablen waren negativ mit der Intensität des lokalen Pestizideinsatzes verknüpft. Direktsaat-Systeme beherbergten eine höhere Diversität von granivoren Carabiden, zeigten aber keine erhöhte Granivorie. Wir zeigten, dass Landschaftsfaktoren einen stärkeren Einfluss als lokale Bewirtschaftungsfaktoren auf die Dienstleistung ‘Prädation von Unkrautsamen’ haben. Daher sollten Unkrautkontrollstrategien nicht nur die Bewirtschaftung des einzelnen Feldes berücksichtigen, sondern auch die umgebende Landschaft, um die Biodiversität der Laufkäfer zu erhalten und die Prädation von Unkrautsamen zu stärken.","['Carabid', 'Landscape composition', 'No-tillage', 'Plant–animal interactions', 'Trophic guild']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Franziska

Agricultural landscapes and their associated BD provide multiple ES and it is crucial to understand how relationships between ES and BD components change along gradients of landscape complexity. In this study, we related eight ES potentials to the species richness of five invertebrate, vertebrate and plant taxonomic groups in cereal farming systems. The landscape complexity gradient ranged from areas dominated by annually tilled arable land to areas with high proportions of unfertilized, non-rotational pastures and uncultivated field borders. We show that after accounting for landscape complexity relationships between yield and bird richness or biological control became more positive, but relationships between bird richness and biological control became less positive. The relationship between bird and plant richness turned from positive to negative. Multidiversity (overall biodiversity), was positively related to landscape complexity, whereas multifunctionality (overall ES provision), was not significantly related to either one of these. Our results suggest that multidiversity can be promoted by increasing landscape complexity; however; we found no support for a simultaneous increase of several individual ES, BD components or multifunctionality. These results challenge the assumption that biodiversity-friendly landscape management will always simultaneously promote multiple ES in agricultural landscapes. Future studies need to verify this pattern by using multi-year data, larger sets of ES and BD components and a study design that is appropriate to address larger spatial scales and relationships in several regions.","['Biodiversity loss', 'Landscape complexity', 'Multidiversity', 'Multifunctionality', 'Synergies', 'Trade-offs']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Franziska

Manufacturing predominantly relies on fermentation-based production platforms, which have limited scalability and suffer from high upstream process costs. As an alternative, the production of recombinant proteins in whole plants (plant molecular farming) provides a scalable and cost efficient upstream process because each plant functions as a self-contained bioreactor, avoiding costs associated with single-use devices and cleaning-in-place. Despite many proof-of-concept studies and the approval of a few products as medical devices, the only approved pharmaceutical proteins manufactured in whole plants have been authorized under emergency protocols. The absence of approvals under standard clinical development pathways in part reflects the lack of standardized process equipment and unit operations, leading to industry inertia based on familiarity with fermenter systems. Here we discuss the upstream production steps of plant molecular farming by transient expression in intact plants, including seeding, plant cultivation, infiltration with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, post-infiltration incubation, and harvesting. We focus on cultivation techniques because they strongly affect the subsequent steps and overall process design. We compare the benefits and drawbacks of open field, greenhouse and vertical farm strategies in terms of upfront investment costs, batch reproducibility, and decoupling from environmental impacts. We consider process automation, monitoring and adaptive process design in the context of Industry 4.0, which can boost process efficiency and batch-to-batch uniformity to improve regulatory compliance.

The reference spatial units for spatial modeling are 57 within-field areas named _reference zones_ (RZs) homogeneous for their soil properties, constructed in the vicinity of 57 roughness measurement locations, spread across 20 agricultural fields for which TOs were known. The total RZ dataset was half dedicated to successive random selections of training/validating RZs, the remaining half (29 RZs) being kept for validating the final map results. Five supervised per-pixels classifiers were used in order to map 2 TOs classes (seedbed&harrowed and late winter plough) in addition to 4 landuse classes (forest, urban, crops and grass, water bodies): support vector machine with polynomial kernel (pSVM), SVM with radial basis kernel (rSVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and regression tree (RT). All 5 classifiers were implemented in a bootstrapping approach in order to assess the uncertainty of map results. The best results were obtained with pSVM for the SPOT4/ASAR pair with producer's and user's mean validation accuracies (PmVA/UmVA) of 91.7%/89.8% and 73.2%/73.3% for seedbed&harrowed and late winter plough conditions, respectively. Whatever classifier, the SPOT4/ASAR pair appeared to perform better than each of the single images, particularly for late winter plough: PmVA/UmVA of 61.6%/53.0% for the single SPOT4 image; 0%/6% for the single ASAR image. About 73% of the validation agricultural fields (79% of the RZs) were correctly predicted in terms of TOs in the best pSVM-derived final map.

For this we need to develop targeted management solutions that provide critical resources to service‐providing organisms at the right time and place. We tested whether annual strips of early flowering phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia support pollinators and natural enemies of seed weevils Protapion spp., by attracting and offering nectar and pollen before the crop flowers. This was expected to increase yield of red clover Trifolium pratense seed. We monitored insect pollinators, pests, natural enemies and seed yields in a total of 50 clover fields along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, over 2 years and across two regions in southern Sweden. About half of the fields were sown with flower strips of 125–2,000 m2. The clover fields were pollinated by 60% bumble bees Bombus spp. and 40% honey bees Apis mellifera. The clover seed yield was negatively associated with weevil density, but was unrelated to bee species richness and density. Flower strips enhanced bumble bees species richness in the clover fields, with the strongest influence in heterogeneous landscapes. There were few detectable differences between crop fields with and without flower strips. However, long‐tongued bumble bees were redistributed toward field interiors and during phacelia bloom honey bees toward field edges. Clover seed yield also increased with increasing size of the flower strip. We conclude that annual flower strips of early flower resources can support bumble bee species richness and, if sufficiently large, possibly also increase crop yields. However, clover seed yield was mainly limited by weevil infestation, which was not influenced by the annual flower strips. A future goal should be to design targeted measures for pest control.","['Agricultural management', 'Agricultural production', 'Animal behavior', 'Apis mellifera', 'Bees', 'Biology', 'Bombus', 'Clover', 'Crop fields', 'Crop yield', 'Crops', 'Density', 'Ecosystem services', 'Ecosystems', 'Environmental impact', 'Flowering', 'Flowers', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infestation', 'Insects', 'Landscape', 'Natural enemies', 'Nectar', 'Pest control', 'Pests', 'Plant reproduction', 'Pollen', 'Pollination', 'Pollinators', 'Protapion', 'Red clover', 'Resource management', 'Species richness', 'Trifolium pratense', 'biological control', 'ecological intensification', 'ecosystem services', 'floral resources', 'habitat enhancement', 'pollination', 'red clover']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Franziska

As a result, the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) passed in 2000 is widely regarded as successful legislation for promoting bioenergy development. More than 1000 biogas plants were constructed in Central Germany (CG) between 2000 and 2014. Despite this, few studies have been conducted for this period, which systematically investigate how environmental, social and economic factors, as well as various EEG amendments have impacted biogas production or what the environmental consequences of biogas production development in CG have been.MethodsThe impacts of environmental, social and economic factors and different EEG amendments on biogas production decisions in CG were quantified using a multivariate linear regression model and the event study econometric technique. A GIS-based spatial analysis was also conducted to provide insight into the changes to agricultural land use that resulted from the development of biogas plants during the EEG period.ResultsThe main finding was that the income diversification effect resulting from biogas production was the most important factor in a farmer’s decision to adopt biogas production. In addition, all of the EEG amendments had a significant influence on the adoption of biogas production; however, EEG III and IV, which tried to promote small-scale plants, were unable to reduce the average size of the plants constructed in these two amendment periods. From a landscape perspective, there was a striking increase in the cultivation of silage maize in CG from 2000 to 2014. Silage maize was intensively cultivated in regions with a high installed biogas plant capacity. Since the first EEG amendment, permanent grassland area slightly increased while arable land area declined in CG.ConclusionsThe adoption of biogas production in CG was strongly driven by economic incentives for the farmers, more precisely, by the incentive to diversify their income sources. In addition to increase the subsidy, future EEG amendments should find new measures to encourage the adoption of small-scale biogas plants, which had been unsuccessful in EEG amendments III and IV.","['Agricultural economics', 'Agricultural land', 'Alternative energy sources', 'Arable land', 'Behavior finance', 'Biogas', 'Biogas plant', 'Construction planning', 'Corn', 'EEG', 'Economic factors', 'Economic incentives', 'Economics', 'Energy', 'Energy industry', 'Energy resources', 'Energy sources', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental impact', 'Event study', 'Farmers', 'Grasslands', 'Incentives', 'Income', 'Land use', 'Land use change', 'Legislation', 'Regression analysis', 'Regression models', 'Renewable Energy Sources Act', 'Renewable energy', 'Renewable energy sources', 'Renewable resources', 'Silage', 'Spatial analysis']",no,no,GE,yes,yes,dataset,Franziska

Also, the level of biological control in the field is affected by both within-field and landscape scale management. A multi-taxa approach that integrates multiple scales of management is needed to understand drivers for pest mortality. We examined local (weed cover and soil characteristics) and landscape (proportions of semi-natural and oilseed rape habitat) effects on natural enemy communities and biological control of pollen beetles in 15 oilseed rape (OSR) fields in Sweden. We found that agricultural intensification at the local (low weed cover) and landscape scale (low proportion of semi-natural area) increased evenness of generalist predators, but had no effect on the densities of pests and their natural enemies. This suggests that the generalist predators in OSR are well adapted to crop lands, at least within the examined gradient. Increasing OSR in the landscape decreased parasitoid densities and increased pest density, indicating a potential loss of pest control services by specialist natural enemies in landscapes with a high proportion of OSR. Finally, pollen beetle mortality increased with ground-dwelling generalist predator abundance and soil clay content. Parasitism rates did not affect pest mortality, which is interesting as parasitoids have been considered major control agents in OSR. The hypothesis that increasing semi-natural habitat in the landscape enhances natural enemy abundances and species richness in agricultural landscapes was not supported.

These services consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed using indicators, e.g. microbial biomass as an indicator of supporting services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil services – organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and retention) – in barley fields, leys and permanent pastures along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000m radii). In addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were consistently lower than in permanent pastures. Leys supported greater microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However, landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH, suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing barley yield and the soil indicators. The results suggest that soil ES are determined at the field level, with little influence from the surrounding landscape, and that greater crop yields do not necessarily come at the expense of supporting soil services.","['Ecosystem services', 'Landscape complexity', 'Microbial community', 'Mycorrhiza', 'Soil carbon', 'Trade-offs']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Franziska

The inefficiency of the traditional methods used in obtaining this information is increasingly paving the way for Remote Sensing (RS). The Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm is a well-known method for segmenting objects from images. The quality of segmentation depends on the a priori knowledge of which scale, shape and compactness values to use. With each parameter taking a varied range of input values, this research developed an automated approach for identifying the optimal parameter set without testing all possible combinations. At the core of our approach is Bayesian optimization, which is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) method for maximizing or minimizing an objective function. We maximized the Jaccard index, which is a measure that indicates the similarity between segmented agricultural objects and their corresponding reference parcels. As the optimal parameter combination varies between different agricultural landscapes, they were determined at a grid resolution of 10 km. Mono-temporal Sentinel-2 images covering Lower Saxony in Germany were tiled to these grids and the optimal parameters were subsequently identified for each tiled grid. The optimal parameter combinations identified over the grids varied considerably, which indicated that a single parameter combination would have failed to achieve optimal segmentation. We found that the quality of segmentation correlated with the size of agricultural parcels. Under-segmentation was largely minimized but in areas with a predominant agricultural land-use, it was unavoidable. In agricultural parcels composed of heterogeneous pixels, over-segmentation was prevalent. Our approach outperformed other segmentation optimization methods existing in the literature.

Monitoring schemes and national cadasters provide a rich source of information but their maintenance and regular updating is costly and labor-intensive. Automatized mapping of fields based on remote sensing imagery may aid in this task and allow for a faster and more regular observation. Although remote sensing has seen extensive use in agricultural research topics, such as plant health monitoring, crop type classification, yield prediction, and irrigation, field delineation and extraction has seen comparatively little research interest. In this study, we present a field boundary detection technique based on deep learning and a variety of image features, and combine it with the graph-based growing contours (GGC) method to extract agricultural fields in a study area in northern Germany. The boundary detection step only requires red, green, and blue (RGB) data and is therefore largely independent of the sensor used. We compare different image features based on color and luminosity information and evaluate their usefulness for the task of field boundary detection. A model based on texture metrics, gradient information, Hessian matrix eigenvalues, and local statistics showed good results with accuracies up to 88.2%, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of up to 0.94, and F1 score of up to 0.88.

In view of this, a LPIS Conceptual Model (LCM) is presented in this paper in order to address harmonisation and data quality needs. The ISO 19100 series standards on geoinformatics were used for LCM development, including an UML modelling approach and the handling of the quality of geographical information. This paper describes the core elements of the LCM and their integration with data supporting management of agri-environment schemes. Later, the paper shows how the LCM is used for conformity and quality checks of the member states' LPIS system; an Abstract Test Suite (ATS) for mapping the LCM model against existing system implementations was developed and tested in collaboration with several member states.","['Agriculture/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Conserva', 'Conservation of Natural Resources/methods', 'Environmental Policy/legislation & jurisprudence', 'European Union', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Government Regulation', 'Models', 'Theoretical', 'compliance', 'environm', 'environmental law', 'farmers', 'geographic information systems', 'information systems', 'models', 'spatial data', 'subsidies']",yes,?,?,yes,no,,Franziska

They are biological and biogeochemical hotspots. Due to small size, small perimeter and shallow depth biological and biogeochemical processes in kettle holes are closely linked to the dynamics and the emissions of the terrestrial environment. On the other hand, their intriguing high spatial and temporal variability makes a sound understanding of the terrestrial-aquatic link very difficult. It is presumed that intensive agricultural land use during the last decades has resulted in a ubiquitous high nutrient load. However, the water quality encountered at single sites highly depends on internal biogeochemical processes and thus can differ substantially even between adjacent sites. This study aimed at elucidating the interplay between external drivers and internal processes based on a thorough analysis of a comprehensive kettle hole water quality data set. To study the role of external drivers, effects of land use in the adjacent terrestrial environment, effects of vegetation at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and that of kettle hole morphology on water quality was investigated. None of these drivers was prone to strong with-in year variability. Thus temporal variability of spatial patterns could point to the role of internal biogeochemical processes. To that end, the temporal stability of the respective spatial patterns was studied as well for various solutes. All of these analyses were performed for a set of different variables. Different results for different solutes were then used as a source of information about the respective driving processes. In the Quillow catchment in the Uckermark region, about 100km north of Berlin, Germany, 62 kettle holes have been regularly sampled since 2013. Kettle hole catchments were determined based on a groundwater level map of the uppermost aquifer. The catchments were not clearly related to topography. Spatial patterns of kettle hole water concentration of (earth) alkaline metals and chloride were fairly stable, presumably reflecting solute concentration of the uppermost aquifer. In contrast, spatial patterns of nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes within the kettle holes were hardly correlated between different sampling campaigns. Correspondingly, effects of season, hydrogeomorphic kettle hole type, shore vegetation or land use in the respective catchments were significant but explained only a minor portion of the total variance. It is concluded that internal processes mask effects of the terrestrial environment. There is some evidence that denitrification and phosphorus release from the sediment during frequent periods of hypoxia might play a major role. The latter seems to boost primary production occasionally. These processes do not follow a clear seasonal pattern and are still not well understood.","['Hydrogeomorphic type', 'Kettle holes', 'Land use', 'Ponds', 'Shore vegetation', 'Water quality']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Franziska

Those indicators can be useful tools for national and regional management and support decision making processes. We propose degree of naturalness (Nd), distance to natural habitat (Dn) and the composite index distance to nature (D2N) as a highly comprehensible environmental indicator set that can be used as surrogate for land use related anthropogenic influence on biodiversity. A high resolution naturalness map for Austria based on the best nationwide available land use data was produced and used to test and demonstrate the applicability of the indicator set. Spatially inclusive and comprehensive indicator maps were calculated for the entire country (83,872km2). Exemplary indicator values for all 2359 municipalities and six altitudinal zones were calculated and evaluated. Indicator maps of Austria clearly delimitate regions with elevated anthropogenic pressure on biodiversity due to land use characteristics. A sensitivity analysis conducted to evaluate the effect of land use data with different spatial and thematic resolution on the indicators showed that Dn reacts sensitive to spatially more detailed information about natural and near natural habitats. By contrast Nd and D2N were robust regarding the spatial and thematic resolution of input data. The proposed indicators do not measure biodiversity or a part of it directly, but the degree of habitat changes caused by anthropogenic land use, therefore they can be used for analysis over wide geographic ranges including different bio-geographic or climatic zones, and different spatial scales.","['Austria', 'GIS', 'Hemeroby', 'Land use', 'Landscape indicator', 'Naturalness']",yes,no,AT,yes,no,,Franziska

One of the main reasons lies in the fact the imagery that can be used operationally and economically over large areas with high temporal frequency have coarse spatial resolution. However, recent research has demonstrated that coherent crop specific biophysical variables such as green area index (GAI) can be retrieved from medium spatial resolution imagery such as MODIS even when the size of the fields is close to the size of the pixels (close to 250m). Leveraging on these results, the present paper attempts to go beyond by retrieving GAI from a more fragmented landscape, over a much larger geographical area and covering a 10-year period. Results demonstrate the possibility to monitor the dynamic processes of growth and senescence of winter wheat and grasp the inter-annual seasonal variability of growing conditions encountered over a decade. Furthermore, the satellite-derived GAI is not only consistent with ground measurements at regional scale (RMSE=0.65m2/m2, RRMSE=25.7%), but even shows encouraging results at field level (RMSE=0.82m2/m2, RRMSE=37.6%, when pixel/field spatial adequacy is high). By showing the possibility of monitoring crop specific growth quantitatively over a complicated landscape, the major step necessary before implementing such approach in operational situation remains identifying early in the season where the target crop is.","['Canopy radiative transfer', 'Crop growth monitoring', 'Green area index (GAI)', 'Inter-annual variability', 'MODIS', 'Regional scale', 'Winter wheat']",?,?,Other,yes,yes,country,Franziska

Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches have been based on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence at the level of the farmer's block as mapped in the French land parcel identification system. Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of ""marginal land"" by integrating also the farm management criteria.

Energetic agroecosystem productivity (energy contents of crops, livestock products, and wood per unit area) is compared to different types of energy inputs, i.e., external inputs from society (labor, industrial inputs, and external biomass inputs) and biomass reused from the local agroecosystem (feed, litter, and seeds). Energy transfers between different compartments of the agroecosystem (agricultural land, forest, and livestock) are also quantified. This allows for delineating an agroecosystem energy transition: In the first stage of this transition, i.e., in the nineteenth century, agroecosystem productivity was low (final produce ranged between 14 and 27&#xa0;GJ/ha/yr), and local biomass reused made up 97% of total energy inputs in both regions (25–61&#xa0;GJ/ha/yr). In this period, agroecosystem productivity increase was achieved primarily through more recycling of energy flows within the agroecosystems. In the second stage of the agroecosystem energy transition, i.e., after World War II, external energy inputs increased by factors 2.5 (Sankt Florian) and 5.0 (Grünburg), partly replacing local energy transfers. Final produce per area increased by factors 6.1 (Sankt Florian) and 2.9 (Grünburg). The difference in the resulting energy returns on investment (EROI) owes to regional specialization on cropping versus livestock rearing and to increasing market integration. Our results suggest that sustainable land-use intensification may benefit from some regional specialization harnessing local production potentials based on a mix of local and external inputs.","['Agricultural ecosystems', 'Agricultural land', 'Agroecosystem energy flows', 'Agroecosystem energy transition', 'Biomass', 'EROI', 'Energy', 'Energy efficiency', 'Energy policy', 'Environmental Studies', 'Integration', 'Land use', 'Livestock', 'Long-term socio-ecological research', 'Markets', 'Productivity', 'Seeds', 'Specialization', 'Sustainable use', 'Wood']",no,no,AT,yes,yes,dataset,Franziska

In that context, it is crucial to understand how landscape characteristics drive the presence of rare endangered species. Nevertheless, it is also important to study common species in multiple habitats, because they represent a large proportion of biodiversity and are essential to maintain ecological functions. Interestingly, some habitats, as farmlands with permanent crops (e.g. vineyards), have been overlooked in the literature. Methods In this study, we investigated the distribution of a widespread and common bird species, the Common Blackbird (Turdus merula), within and between the three main habitats of our study area (rural Western France). We specifically focused on (1) woodlands, (2) farmlands with a high vineyard coverage, and (3) moderately urbanized areas. Specifically, we aimed to assess the beneficial and detrimental effects of these habitats and their fine-scale composition on the presence of a common bird species, relying on a survey by point counts (nearly 100 locations). We studied the effects of habitats and gradients of fine-scale habitat composition on blackbird presence using logistic regression analyses. Results Blackbirds were present in all studied habitats. However, their presence varied between habitats, being lower in vineyards than in woodlands and cities. In woodlands and cities, fine-scale analyses did not reveal any component driving the species’ presence. However, we found that shrub and tree vegetation cover had a significant positive effect on blackbird presence in vineyards. Conclusions Our results are in agreement with the definition of a generalist species. Interestingly, species distribution varied between habitats. The high presence of blackbirds in urban areas suggests that medium-sized cities, despite their artificialization, do not constrain the settlement of this former forest specialist and that green spaces may allow blackbirds to thrive in medium-sized cities. On the contrary, we found an impoverished presence of blackbirds in vineyards and a positive effect of vegetation on their presence in these landscapes. This suggests that permanent crops, and more generally farmlands, may impose important constraints to common species. Future studies should examine how to enhance biodiversity through agricultural management policies, especially in vineyards.","['Agriculture', 'Animal behavior', 'Biodiversity', 'Biology--Ornithology', 'Birds', 'Censuses', 'Cities', 'Crops', 'Endangered species', 'Forest', 'France', 'Geographical distribution', 'Habitats', 'Land use', 'Rare species', 'Topographic databases', 'Turdus merula', 'Urbanization', 'Vegetation', 'Vineyards', 'Wineries & vineyards']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Franziska

In our study, we analyse the effects of mitigation measures on the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus), which is directly affected by ongoing land use change and has experienced widespread decline throughout Europe since the 1960s. Therefore, we developed a spatially explicit and individual-based ecological model to study the effects of different landscape configurations and compositions on hare population development. As an input, we used two 4 × 4 km large model landscapes, which were generated by a landscape generator based on real field sizes and crop proportions and differed in average field size and crop composition. The crops grown annually are evaluated in terms of forage suitability, breeding suitability and crop richness for the hare. In six mitigation scenarios, we investigated the effects of a 10 % increase in the following measures: (1) mixed silphie, (2) miscanthus, (3) grass-clover ley, (4) alfalfa, (5) set-aside, and (6) general crop richness. All mitigation measures had significant effects on hare population development. Compared to the base scenario, the relative change in hare abundance ranged from a factor of 0.56 in the grass-clover ley scenario to -0.16 in the miscanthus scenario. The mitigation measures of mixed silphie, grass-clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundance in both landscapes (> 0.3). The results show that both landscape configuration and composition have a significant effect on hare population development, which responds particularly strongly to compositional changes. The increase in crop diversity, e.g., through the cultivation of alternative energy crops such as mixed silphie and grass-clover ley, proves to be beneficial for the brown hare.","['Agent-based modelling', 'Agriculture', 'European brown hare', 'Land-Use change', 'Mitigation measures']",yes,yes,GE,yes,no,,Franziska

In our study, we assessed the influence of permanent grassland connectivity, described by grassland amount and spatial configuration, on grassland biodiversity. We selected permanent grasslands in livestock farming areas of north-western France, which were sampled for plants, carabids and birds. At two spatial scales we tested the effects of amount and configuration of grasslands, wooded habitats and crops on richness and abundance of total assemblages and species ecological groups. Grassland connectivity had no significant effects on total richness or abundance of any taxonomic group, regardless of habitat affinity or dispersal ability. The amount of wooded habitat and length of wooded edges at the 200&#xa0;m scale positively influenced forest and generalist animal groups as well as grassland plant species, in particular animal-dispersed species. However, for animal groups such as open habitat carabids or farmland bird specialists, the same wooded habitats negatively influenced richness and abundance at the 500&#xa0;m scale. The scale and direction of biodiversity responses to landscape context were therefore similar among taxonomic groups, but opposite for habitat affinity groups. We conclude that while grassland connectivity is unlikely to contribute positively to biodiversity, increasing or maintaining wooded elements near grasslands would be a worthwhile conservation goal.

Concerns have been raised about potential adverse environmental impacts of the GMO and about potential implications on the coexistence between conventional and genetically modified production. These issues should be considered on a regional base. The objective of this article is to describe how GMO monitoring that is required after risk assessment and GMO release can be complemented by a Web-based geoinformation system (WebGIS). Secondly, it is also described how WebGIS techniques might support coexistence issues with regard to Bt-maize cultivation and conservation areas. Accordingly, on the one hand, the WebGIS should enable access to relevant geodata describing the receiving environment, including information on cultivation patterns and conservation areas containing protected species and habitats. On the other hand, metadata on already established environmental monitoring networks should be provided as well as measurement data of the intended GMO monitoring. Based on this information and based on the functionality provided by the WebGIS, the application helps in detecting possible environmental GMO impacts and in avoiding or identifying coexistence problems. The WebGIS applies Web mapping techniques to generate maps via internet requests and offers additional functionality for analysis, processing and publication of selected geodata. It is based on open source software solely. The developments rely on a combination of the University of Minnesota (UMN ) MapServer with the Apache HTTP server, the open source database management systems MySQL and PostgreSQL and the graphical user interface provided by Mapbender. Important information on the number and the location of Bt-maize fields were derived from the GMO location register of BVL. The ""WebGIS GMO Monitoring"" provides different tools allowing for the application of basic GIS techniques as, for instance, automatic or interactive zooming, distance measurements or querying attribute information from selected GIS layers. More sophisticated GIS tools were implemented additionally, e.g. a buffer function which enables generating buffers around selected geo-objects like Bt-maize fields. Finally, a function for intersection of different maps was developed. The WebGIS comprises information on the location of all Bt-maize fields in Germany according to the official GMO location register of the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety between 2005 and 2008. It facilitates, amongst others, access to geodata of GMO fields and their surroundings and can relate them with additional environmental data on climate, soil, and agricultural patterns. Furthermore, spatial data on the location of flora-fauna-habitats and environmental monitoring sites in the federal state of Brandenburg were integrated. The WebGIS GMO monitoring was implemented according to the concept for an ""Information System for Monitoring GMO"" (ISMO) which was designed on behalf of the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. ISMO includes hypotheses-based ecological effects of GMO cultivation and suggests checkpoints for GMO monitoring to test whether impacts may be observed in the receiving environment. In contrast to the public GMO register, the WebGIS GMO monitoring enables mapping of GMO fields and provides relevant geodata describing environmental and agricultural conditions in their neighbourhood of the cultivation sites as well as information derived from monitoring sites. On this basis, spatial analyses should be enabled and supported, respectively. Further, the WebGIS GMO monitoring supplements PortalU which, in Germany, is the technical realisation of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe directive (Directive 2007/2/EC) released by the EU in 2007. The article should have shown how to support and complement GMO monitoring with the help of the WebGIS application. It facilitates co-operation and data access across spatial scales for different users since it is based on internet technologies. The WebGIS improves storage, analysis, management and presentation of spatial data. Apart from the improved flow of information, it supports future long-term GMO monitoring and modelling of the dispersal of transgenic pollen, for instance. Additional information (e.g. data on wind conditions or soil observation sites) provided by the WebGIS will be helpful to determine representative monitoring sites for detecting potential GMO impacts by means of monitoring or modelling. Thus, the WebGIS can also serve as part of an early warning system. In the near future, the integration of locations of all Bt-maize fields in Germany into the WebGIS as a continuous task should be automatised. Additionally, a methodology should be developed to detect maize fields by means of remote sensing data to manage coexistence problems on the basis of actual field patterns.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",['Environmental Studies'],no,?,DE,yes,yes,dataset,Franziska

Farmers in the European Union receive support through a Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that comprises direct payments to farmers (Pillar I) and payments related to rural development measures (Pillar II). This paper examines the ways in which agroforestry can support European agriculture and rural development drawing on the conclusions of 23 papers presented in this Special Issue of Agroforestry Systems which have been produced during a 4-year research project called AGFORWARD. The project had the goal of promoting agroforestry in Europe and focused on four types of agroforestry: (1) existing systems of high nature and cultural value, and agroforestry for (2) high value tree, (3) arable, and (4) livestock systems. The project has advanced our understanding of the extent of agroforestry in Europe and of farmers’ perceptions of agroforestry, including the reasons for adoption or non-adoption. A participatory approach was used with over 40 stakeholder groups across Europe to test selected agroforestry innovations through field trials and experiments. Innovations included improved grazing management in agroforestry systems of high nature and cultural value and the introduction of nitrogen fixing plants in high value timber plantations and olive groves. Other innovations included shelter benefits for arable crops, and disease-control, nutrient-retention, and food diversification benefits from integrating trees in livestock enterprises.

While such meadows are typical habitats for temperate Europe, they experienced a decline in their total area during the second half of the 20th century, both in Western and Eastern Europe. In this contribution, we compare their current area and status in terms of semantics, law, public support in general, and the efficiency of public support in both Saxony and the Czech Republic. We estimated the area in Saxony on the basis of three public mapping projects. In the Czech Republic, where no recent mapping included orchard meadows as a specific land-use type, we carried out our own mapping. Hence, we mapped 124 randomly selected plots of 1 km2. To cross-reference results from both countries, we used the pan-EU project LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey). According to various different sources, the orchard meadows cover 0.09–0.55% of Saxony and 0.01–0.72% of the Czech Republic. Interestingly, the results of the three mapping projects conducted in Saxony vary from each other. Although orchard meadows are supported by financial incentives of the respective governments in both countries, the Saxon approach concentrating more on individual activities (sanitation of old trees, planting, grassland management), seems more focused than the single measure practised in the Czech Republic. One key to a greater public awareness of the orchard meadow problematic can lie in the promotion of a simple expression referring to this specific landscape feature in Czech, similar to the phrase common in the German language: ‘Streuobstwiese’. Our suggestion for the Czech language is: ‘luční sad’.","['Czech Republic', 'Geography', 'Germany', 'Grassland management', 'Grasslands', 'Incentives', 'LUCAS', 'Land use', 'Language', 'Mapping', 'Meadows', 'Orchard meadow', 'Public awareness', 'Sanitation', 'Semantics', 'Streuobst', 'agricultural policy']",yes,yes,CZ/DE,yes,no,,Franziska

We conducted the online interviews, with a total of 598 adequately answered questionnaires in summer 2017. The resulting sample is representative of German farmers, as the distribution of participants corresponds very well to the percentage distribution of farms in Germany. The survey contained a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a structured survey of 30 sub-aspects of rewards to be expected from the application of a sustainability standard and a risk elicitation lottery choice-task. Besides, the personal characteristics of the farmers (e.g. gender, education, communication behaviour, age) and farm characteristics (e.g. farm type, size, labour, profit) were recorded. Since the complete raw dataset cannot be published due to the privacy rights of human subjects and the stated data use agreement (DUA) with the participants, the present article demonstrates the data collection process, describes the parameter of the DCE and, present summary statistics of the sample. In addition, we illustrate the variables coding and data structure using a model data set with 10 generated entries. Further, a reduced and edited exercise dataset, which is structured analogous to the real dataset, is used to demonstrate the analysis of the DCE data step-by-step. The results and the interpretation of the actual DCE data analysis are published in the article 'Acceptance of sustainability standards among farmers' - empirical evidence from Germany' [1]. The survey data can provide further insights on farmers' expected rewards from participating in a sustainability standard, on the role of risk perception and tolerance of German farmers, and the role of communication behaviour in the innovation adoption context.","['Choice experiment', 'Expected reward', 'Farm sustainability standard', 'Innovation adoption', 'Risk elicitation', 'Standard design', 'Willingness-to-accept']",no,no,DE,yes,yes,,Franziska

We use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to assess the effectiveness of the measures applied, and we develop an aggregated bio-economic model using the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) to evaluate the costs of their implementation. Finally, we propose a ranking of these measures based on their cost-effectiveness ratios. This approach is applied to the Gers river basin in southwest France. The findings clearly demonstrate that of all the measures we considered, grass strips and mechanical weeding are the most cost-effective in reducing pesticide-related water pollution. On the other hand, measures such as longer rotation sequences and catch crops, although relatively inexpensive to implement, fall short in terms of reducing pesticide pollution. Furthermore, we found that the cost and effectiveness of measures largely depended on where they were implemented, as the framework proposed takes account of physical variables and farm activities scattered within the watershed.

Especially under changing environmental conditions there is an increasing need of identifying management options for preserving biodiversity. However, the design of historical data sets is often inappropriate for detecting biodiversity responses to ongoing rapid changes. Here, we present an approach to quantify plant species diversity and relate it to land use diversity. Data mining took place at the landscape scale in two mountainous regions of Central Europe, differing in natural and cultural history. Within these landscapes a representative systematic rectangular grid (7×7 plots of 1ha) was sampled. At each plot polygons of uniform land use were mapped and presence–absence data of plant species were recorded. Plant species diversity differed significantly between landscapes: species richness and within landscape beta diversity in the calcareous mosaic landscape was higher than in the siliceous mosaic landscape. Land use diversity explained the significant variation in species richness. The relationship between plant species diversity and land use diversity is consistent in different cultivated landscapes and on multiple scales. The chosen sampling approach integrates the advantage of random but grid-based sampling with land use polygon specific information. This enables not only to investigate also similarity pattern (in land use and species composition) but also an integration of further information on the patch scale, if needed.","['Additive partitioning', 'Biodiversity monitoring', 'Germany', 'Land use patch', 'Scaling effects', 'Systematic grid']",no,?,GE,yes,yes,dataset,Franziska

Due to intensive agricultural activities and a lack of wastewater treatment plants in small settlements, the water quality is deteriorating. As a result, corrective measures need to be taken. Technological Agency of the Czech Republic supported this research which proposes different scenarios for a reduction of water quality degradation in the dam. The Trnávka dam watershed was chosen for study purposes as it occupies one quarter of the Švihov dam watershed. Hydrological balance was established using measured data.

The associated environmental impacts are potentially considerable but will depend on how the agricultural sector develops. Currently, there are contrasting regional developments in agriculture; expansion and/or intensification in some regions and abandonment in others, as well as changes in the type of farming. However, the environmental consequences of changes in farm type are not well understood. Objective We have evaluated the impacts of farm type on food production and three key environmental variables—landscape openness, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions—in three marginal agricultural regions in Sweden. Methods We do this by first dividing the population of farms in each region into types, based on their land-use and livestock holdings using an innovative clustering method. Thereafter we analysed changes in production activities for farm types over time and evaluated the environmental and food-production impacts, where landscape openness is quantified using a novel indicator. Results and conclusion Our results show that there is not one single farm type that would simultaneously maximize food production, grassland biodiversity, and landscape openness, whilst minimizing GHG emissions. However, there exists considerable potential to manage the trade-offs between food production and these environmental variables. For example, by reducing land use for dairying and instead increasing both cropping for food production and extensive livestock grazing to maintain landscape openness and biodiversity-rich semi-natural pastures, it would keep food production at similar levels. Significance Our farm typology allows us to assess the multifunctionality of farming, by relating contrasting production activities to multiple ecosystem services, grassland biodiversity and GHG emissions for informing policy towards more sustainable agriculture. We have demonstrated this with examples under Swedish conditions, but it should to a large extent also be applicable for other countries.","['Agriculture', 'Biodiversity', 'Ecosystem services', 'Farm typology', 'Food production', 'Landscape openness']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Heidi

In commercial vineyards in Austria we sampled earthworms by handsorting, springtails by soil coring and pitfall trapping and installed litter decomposition bags. Earthworm species diversity increased with plant biomass under PMD but not under PGC; earthworm density was unaffected by tillage but increased with plant biomass mainly at high soil quality (soil fertility index).

The general population can be exposed to them. Given the suspected effects of pesticides on the development of the foetus, exposure to pyrethroids during pregnancy is a major public health concern. The objective of this paper is to describe the urinary levels of the following five pyrethroid metabolites and their associated determinants among pregnant French women in 2011 enrolled in the Elfe cohort (n = 1077): a) 3-phenoxy benzoic (3-PBA), b) 4‑fluoro‑3‑phenoxy benzoic acid (4-F-3-PBA), c) Cis‑3‑(2,2dibromovinyl)‑2,2‑dimethyl cyclopropane-carboxylic acid (Cis-DBCA); d) Cis‑3‑(2,2dichlorovinyl)‑2,2‑dimethyl cyclopropane-carboxylic acid (Cis-DCCA) and e) Trans-3‑(2,2dichlorovinyl)‑2,2‑dimethyl cyclopropane-carboxylic acid (Trans-DCCA). The distribution levels were estimated for each pyrethroid metabolite. Multivariable analyses helped determine the predictors of these levels. All metabolites except 4-F-3-PBA were detected in all the urine samples. The mean urinary concentration of the sum of the metabolites (3-PBA, Cis-DBCA, Cis-DCCA, Trans-DCCA) was 1.18 μg/L, with the highest concentrations observed for 3-PBA. A comparison of these levels with other studies showed that pregnant French women tend to be more exposed to pyrethroids than their American counterparts, less exposed than Chinese and Caribbean mothers, and have similar exposure to Japanese mothers. In our study, urinary levels of pyrethroid metabolites were positively related to smoking during pregnancy, consuming fish and alcohol, domestic pesticide use and living in the vicinity of crops during pregnancy. These findings highlight the importance of non-dietary pathways when evaluating exposure to pyrethroids.","['Biomonitoring', 'Environmental exposure', 'Predictors', 'Pregnant women', 'Pyrethroid']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Heidi

The development of adaptation strategies requires model predictions, but for the necessary large-scale SOM dynamic studies, the quality of the input data is often limiting the reliability of the results. So we performed a uncertainty and sensitivity analysis at different sites of the federal state of Saxony, Germany, and assessed the importance of aggregated agricultural data, namely organic amendments, crop yields, area share of by-product incorporation, area share of conservation tillage and initial soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration (p_oram, p_yield, p_bp, p_cons and p_soc respectively) on the result uncertainty by assuming an uniform error of ±10%. The agricultural data was regionalized from 717 long-term observation fields throughout the study region. We assessed the uncertainties of relative SOC stock change (ΔCrel) and total nitrogen mineralisation from the organic matter (OM-Nmin) and explored the changing sensitivities over the model period (1998–2014). Our results show that p_soc was the most important source of uncertainty for all sites of this study. For ΔCrel, it is over the whole time constantly the by far most sensitive input parameter, with p_bp being the only factor of agricultural practice with some substantial influence on almost all sites. In the mountainous regions, p_cons ranks equal to p_bp, while for the sandy heathlands, none of them mark a substantial influence besides p_soc. For OM-Nmin, p_soc loses its importance over time, being outranked by p_oram in the heathlands after 8 years and in the mountainous regions after 13 years. p_oram furthermore places second for all others but one other region, where p_cons is slightly more important. We therefore see the initial carbon content, the share of by-product removal, and the amount of organic amendments as those factors, where improved data quality would bring the highest effect to reduce the uncertainty in regional SOM modelling.","['4 per mille', 'Regional data', 'Uncertainty assessment']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Heidi

In this study, we compare NH3 emissions in France during spring 2011 from one reference inventory, the TNO inventory, and two alternative inventories that account in different manners for both the spatial and temporal variabilities of the emissions: (i) the NH3SAT satellite-derived inventory based on IASI NH3 columns and (ii) the CADASTRE-CIT inventory that combinesNH3 emissions due to nitrogen fertilization calculated with the mechanistic model VOLT'AIR on the database of the CADASTRE_NH3 framework and other source emissions from the CITEPA. The total spring budgets, from March to May 2011, at the national level are higher when calculated with both alternative inventories than with the reference, the difference being more marked with CADASTRE-CIT. NH3SAT and CADASTRE-CIT inventories both yield to large NH3 spring emissions due to fertilization on soils with high pH in the northeastern part of France (65 and 135 ktNH3, respectively, vs. 48 ktNH3 for TNO-GEN), while soil properties are not accounted for by the TNO-GEN methodology. For the other parts of France, the differences are smaller. The timing of fertilization and associated ammonia emissions is closely related to the nitrogen requirements and hence the phenological stage of the crops, and therefore to the crop year's specific weather conditions. Maximum emissions are observed in March for 2011 for some regions for both alternative inventories, while April is the period with maximum emissions for the reference inventory regardless of the region or the year. Comparing the inventories at finer temporal resolutions, typically at daily scale, large differences are found.

It has also been determined that there were statistically significant differences in all selected regions for all observed crops (excluding rapeseed in Moravian-Silesian Region) and Czechia between the shares of individual crops and shares according to the “valuation type structure”. It may be concluded that farmers follow short-term interests (profit) instead of long-term goals (soil fertility) in the selected regions. Moreover, results for Czechia suggest that this trend is becoming more common in every region of Czechia. Thus, the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index was utilized. The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index shows decreasing crop diversity in all selected region, as in Czechia as well. Based on the data analysis, it is possible to identify several crops, which are prevailing (wheat, barley, rapeseed, and fodder crops). Three of these crops (wheat, barley, and rapeseed) in combination with intensive farming and poor crop rotation have been found to be problematic and a potential threat which may cause degradation in soil fertility. Based upon this the following measures have been recommended: First, to focus on proven agricultural practices, including crop rotation and fodder crops. Second, the fodder crops production should be supported, and the structure of the “single area payment subsidies” should reflect the negative impact of the three main prevailing crops (wheat, maize, and barley) on soil fertility and the decrease of livestock production in Czechia.","['Agricultural economics', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agricultural production', 'Agriculture', 'Barley', 'Brassica napus', 'Cereal crops', 'Cereals', 'Codes', 'Crop production', 'Crop rotation', 'Crops', 'Cultural heritage', 'Czech Republic', 'Czechia', 'Data analysis', 'Degradation', 'ESEU', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental degradation', 'Evaluation', 'Farmers', 'Fodder', 'Forage crops', 'Hypotheses', 'Identification systems', 'Intensive farming', 'International organizations', 'Livestock', 'Livestock feed', 'OLP', 'Optimal yield', 'Prices', 'Production capacity', 'Profits', 'Quality', 'Rapeseed', 'Raw materials', 'Research & development--R&D', 'Soil conservation', 'Soil degradation', 'Soil erosion', 'Soil fertility', 'Soil water', 'Soils', 'Statistical analysis', 'Subsidies', 'VTS', 'Valuation', 'Water conservation', 'Wheat', 'crop diversity', 'official land price', 'valuation type structure']",yes,yes,CZ,yes,no,,Heidi

Our approach allows for the automatic integration of temporal knowledge, i.e., crop rotations using existing parcel-based land cover databases and multi-modal Sentinel-1 and -2 time series. The temporal evolution of crop types was modeled with a linearchain conditional random field, trained with time series of multi-modal (radar and optical) satellite acquisitions and associated LPIS. Our model was tested on two study areas in France (>= 1250 km(2)) which show different crop types, various parcel sizes, and agricultural practices: .the Seine et Marne and the Alpes de Haute-Provence classified accordingly to a fine national 25-class nomenclature. We first trained a Random Forest classifier without temporal structure to achieve 89.0% overall accuracy in Seine et Marne (10 classes) and 73% in Alpes de Haute-Provence (14 classes). We then demonstrated experimentally that taking into account the temporal structure of crop rotation with our model resulted in an increase of 3% to +5% in accuracy. This increase was especially important (+12%) for classes which were poorly classified without using the temporal structure.

Here, we modelled population sizes of five farmland birds in central Germany as the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD) is based on this taxon. We explored options for sustainable farmland management by generating land-use scenarios at the regional scale. For individual bird species, high SISD scores could be reached by changing environmental variables, such as landscape or crop diversity, percent cover of spring cereals or hedge density. However, contrasting species responses to these variables prevented from reaching high scores for all species simultaneously. We were able to improve the total SISD score from 0.77 at present to 0.94 by increasing landscape and crop diversity or to 0.87 by increasing hedge density and reducing spring cereals, respectively. An economic evaluation of the return losses associated with these changes revealed that annual costs of approx. 5.5€/ha farmland would suffice for this latter increase by optimizing hedges and spring cereals towards high SISD. We conclude that balancing three levels of trade-offs, i.e. contrasting requirements of species, diverging responses in different landscapes, and alternative economic options, is difficult to achieve without systematic modelling. Yet, by accounting for differences in landscape structure and species distributions at a regional spatial scale and by focusing on clearly defined measures such as hedge density or the cover of spring cereals rather than composite indices like landscape or crop diversity it seems possible to develop realisable, affordable and sustainable management strategies.","['Agri-environmental scheme', 'Biodiversity conservation', 'Cost efficiency', 'German sustainability indicator for species divers', 'Landscape planning', 'Sustainable management']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Heidi

This interdisciplinary approach investigates three muddy floods, which developed on silty soils of loess origin tending to soil surface sealing. To achieve this, the study focuses on the test of a historical forecast modeling of three muddy floods in ungauged agricultural landscapes. Therefore, this approach firstly illustrates the reconstruction of the muddy floods, which was performed by high-resolution radar precipitation data, physically-based erosion modeling, and the qualitative validation by unmanned aerial vehicle-based orthophotos. Subsequently, historical radar precipitation forecasts served as input data for the physically-based erosion model to test the forecast modeling retrospectively. The model results indicate a possible warning for two of the three muddy floods. This method of a historical forecast modeling of muddy floods seems particularly promising.

The endoparasitoids Phradis interstitialis Thomson and Tersilochus heterocerus Thomson were studied as they are important for the biological control of the pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.) which is a common pest on oilseed rape in Europe. The number of emerging female parasitoids was quantified by capturing the parasitoids in emergence tents from fields where the oilseed rape plants were grown the previous year. The number of emerging P. interstitialis and T. heterocerus were significantly reduced in insecticide treated fields, but the tillage regimes had no effect on the number of emerging females of either parasitoid species.

Frequently, the use of marginal or set‐aside farmland for biofuel crops is proposed to meet the increasing demand for biofuels, but avoid conflicts with food production. Potential ecological effects of enhanced bioenergy production in diverse landscapes are, however, still controversial, and a proper assessment requires the consideration of local and regional specifics. We used a yield prediction model to determine the potential yield of Miscanthus on individual fields in a small municipality. Widely available spatial data, conclusions drawn from literature, and local landscape planning data were used to assess the potential ecological effects of Miscanthus cultivation. The specific landscape planning data for the study area provided detailed information on conservation values and land‐use‐related functional deficits. All information was used to classify each field by suitability for Miscanthus production, considering biodiversity, soil erosion, and landscape structure. A subsequent field‐level and landscape‐level evaluation of the potential Miscanthus yields in the suitability classes revealed that overall yield would not be reduced if ecological restrictions were considered and only ‘suitable’ or ‘recommended’ fields were selected for Miscanthus cultivation. Instead of defining one threshold value for an ‘optimal’ amount of Miscanthus in a landscape, we developed different scenarios for increasing amounts of Miscanthus. Our scenario maps and recommendations can be used in regional planning processes as the basis for discussions with stakeholders.

An application of this mapping key to three small sub-catchments of a case study catchment with an area of several hundred square kilometres (one-stage cluster sampling) in Austria clearly reveals that road embankments with subsurface drainage can exert a major influence on emissions and transport pathways of sediment-bound pollutants like particulate phosphorus (PP). Due to this, the semi-empirical, spatially distributed PhosFate model is extended to separately model PP emissions into surface waters via storm drains along road embankments. Furthermore, the overall share of road embankments with subsurface drainage on all road embankments in the case study catchment is inferred with the help of a Bayesian hierarchical model.

The estimate of future agricultural land takes in the Czech Republic previously published in this journal is alarming; however, this is based on arbitrarily determined assumptions. Our contribution brings a more realistic assessment of the extent of expected land takes (example of the Hradec Králové Region). For this purpose, the data from the municipalities’ Planning Analytical Materials (PAM) on buildable areas (and redevelopment areas) and data on the existing expansion of built-up areas are used. Particular attention is paid to the best quality soils included in the 1st and 2nd protection class of agricultural land resources (ALR), because some municipalities located in fertile agricultural areas argue about the necessity to build up good-quality land. The Pearson correlation coefficient has been used for the evaluation to what extent the share of the soils included in the 1st and 2nd protection classes of ALR out of the total area of the municipality is really related to the share of best quality soils in planned buildable areas. The spatial statistics method ‒ geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been used to find spatial deviations from the global relationship model. There is a clear differentiation between the municipalities as to whether they are able to rather protect the best soil or whether they are planning future construction predominantly on it. E.g. in municipalities with about 30–50% of the land included in the 1st and 2nd ALR protection classes, buildable and redevelopment areas are designed from 0 to 100% for these highest classes of ALR protection. However, the total strength of the association (Pearson’s r) between these indicators is large, r = 0.80 (or r = 0.95 when “the point-index value of agricultural land” was used instead of ALR protection classes). The results of GWR show that higher deviations from the model value, both positive and negative ones, are not spatially clustered but located next to each other. Greater deviations occur more frequently in the more fertile western part of the region, where there is a higher pressure on good-quality land, which is either intended for development or protected on the basis of local factors (including spatial planning of individual municipalities). Estimation of future developments has revealed a substantial over-dimensionality of planned buildable areas – they will potentially be built up in more than 100 years.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural resources', 'Construction planning', 'Correlation coefficient', 'Correlation coefficients', 'Deviation', 'Land resources', 'Land use', 'Mathematical analysis', 'Municipalities', 'Redevelopment', 'Regression analysis', 'Soil contamination', 'Soils', 'Urbanization', 'Water Resources', 'buildable areas', 'land take', 'land use change', 'reduction of farmland', 'spatial planning', 'urbanization']",yes,yes,CZ,yes,no,,Heidi

Alternating tillage was compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius of 750 m around the vineyards. Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance (±SD) of 29 (±16.6). Forage availability had the strongest positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows, whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees. Pollination provided by wild bees in viticultural areas can be enhanced by maintaining a diversity of different soil management strategies to improve forage availability in vineyards.

The effects of increasing biogas plants' capacities on the increase of maize and other energy crops area over the years have raised sustainability concerns in the German society. A periodic assessment of the impacts of biomass production is necessary to determine efficient and environmentally sustainable recommendations for future planning processes. Previous studies have neglected the effects of biogas plant capacity, which is directly linked with the amount of biomass required and, thus, is supposed to be a driver for the impacts of biogas production on agricultural lands. Combining the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and Landsat satellite data provides a means to study present and past agricultural landscape. The aim of the study was to map the agricultural lands of Northern Hesse from 2000 to 2015, evaluate the change in maize area and structural diversity (i.e. field edge density) of agricultural fields, and assess if biogas production is a major driver of possible changes. Northern Hesse was consciously chosen, as it represents a typical European low-mountain range region with substantial geographical and agricultural variability. Our results show that from 2000 to 2015 on average, the shares of grassland and summer crops areas decreased by 5.7 percentage points (p.p.) and 5.8 p.p., respectively, while the shares of winter crops and maize areas increased by 9.2 p.p. and 2.2 p.p., respectively. Potential drivers of the change in maize area and structural diversity of agricultural fields, such as the mean capacity of biogas plants (kW), and topographical attributes, such as mean elevation (m) and slope (%) were employed as explanatory variables on a municipality level in multiple linear regression models. The mean biogas capacity and elevation were the most significant drivers of change in maize area (p < 0.05), while biogas capacity and slope were the significant drivers of the change in structural diversity. Maize area increased with an increasing capacity of biogas plants at lower elevations of the study area (p < 0.05). A decrease in the structure of fields, which is an indicator for species and habitat diversity, was observed and this was very much associated with the extent of maize and winter crop production. However, the drivers of the changes in the maize area and structure of fields were of low dimensions with model R2 of 0.21 and 0.35 respectively.

Our aim in this study was to estimate the roles of pollinators, pests and different yield components for organic and conventional white clover seed yields. We surveyed pollinators (honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees), reared the main insect pests (Protapion fulvipes Geoffroy and Hypera spp. weevils) from flowers and measured the yield components (inflorescences per area, flowers per inflorescence, seeds per flower and weight per seed) in organic, conventional untreated and conventional insecticide treated plots in 27 white clover seed fields over two years in southernmost Sweden. Unexpectedly, densities of bees other than honey bees were higher in insecticide treated plots compared to organic plots, but pollinator densities were not related to seed set. The lower pollinator visitation in organic plots might have been caused by pest damage to the flowers, as P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were more common in organic plots than in conventional insecticide treated plots. The abundances of both P. fulvipes and Hypera spp. weevils were negatively related to seed set, with P. fulvipes being most damaging for seed set. Seed yield was considerably lower (42%) in organic plots compared to conventional insecticide treated plots, and this was driven by a lower (36%) seed set. Taken together, our results indicate that pollinator densities are not limiting yields in either conventional or organic white clover seed production, whereas P. fulvipes crop damage is an important factor limiting organic yields via negative effects on seed set.

At the population level, this transmission is strongly constrained by the spatial organization of pastures. The aim of this study was to answer two questions: (i) is the spatial configuration of pastures favourable to the spread of infectious diseases in France? (ii) would biosecurity measures allow decreasing this vulnerability? Based on GIS data, the spatial organization of pastures was represented using networks. Nodes were the 3,159,787 pastures reported in 2010 by the French breeders to claim the Common Agricultural Policy subsidies. Links connected pastures when the distance between them was below a predefined threshold. Premises networks were obtained by aggregating into a single node all the pastures under the same ownership. Although the pastures network was very fragmented when the distance threshold was short (1.5 meters, relevant for a directly-transmitted disease), it was not the case when the distance threshold was larger (500 m, relevant for a vector-borne disease: 97% of the nodes in the largest connected component). The premises network was highly connected as the largest connected component always included more than 83% of the nodes, whatever the distance threshold. Percolation analyses were performed to model the population-level efficacy of biosecurity measures. Percolation thresholds varied according to the modelled biosecurity measures and to the distance threshold. They were globally high (e.g. &gt;17% of nodes had to be removed, mimicking the confinement of animals inside farm buildings, to obtain the disappearance of the large connected component). The network of pastures thus appeared vulnerable to the spread of diseases in France. Only a large acceptance of biosecurity measures by breeders would allow reducing this structural risk.","['Agricultural management', 'Agricultural policy', 'Agricultural resources', 'Animals', 'Contact potentials', 'Culicoides', 'Databases', 'Disease control', 'Disease spread', 'Disease transmission', 'Epidemiology', 'Farm buildings', 'Fever', 'Foot & mouth disease', 'Infections', 'Infectious disease control', 'Infectious diseases', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Livestock', 'Measuring instruments', 'Mimicry', 'Network analysis', 'Nodes', 'Pasture', 'Pathogens', 'Percolation', 'Scale-free networks', 'Sciences: Comprehensive Works', 'Spatial analysis', 'Spatial data', 'Statistical mechanics', 'Subsidies', 'Tuberculosis', 'Vector-borne diseases', 'Vectors (Biology)', 'Veterinary diseases']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Heidi

Using data from 67 arable fields, we examined whether the duration of adoption of in-field conservation agricultural practices (CA) and the landscape context of those arable fields explains the levels of in-field weed seed predation. Our results indicate that landscape and CA, in interaction, do indeed explain a large proportion of the observed variation in weed seed predation in-field. CA practice maintains high in-field abundances of carabids, but only after a period of four years of adoption. Prior to this, carabid abundance was only high for fields in landscapes with high percentage cover of arable crops and/or permanent grassland. Our work shows that the effect of landscape composition is conditional on local in-field management and that both local and landscape scales can be used to enhance the abundance of carabid beetles and the amount of seed predation in arable fields.","['Agroecology', 'Conservation agriculture', 'Granivory', 'Landscape composition', 'Weed regulation']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Heidi

APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data. Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology. The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany. For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90% for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types. In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping.","['Compositing', 'Crop mapping', 'Land cover classification', 'Phenology', 'Random forest', 'Sentinel-2']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Heidi

Its effective sustainability depends greatly on the spatial location of this crop, although few modelling approaches have been based on real maps. To fill this gap, we propose a spatially explicit method based on real location data. We mapped all of the miscanthus fields in the supply area of a transformation plant located in east-central France. Then, we used a boosted regression tree, machine learning method, to model miscanthus presence/absence at the level of the farmer's block as mapped in the French land parcel identification system. Each of these modelling spatial units was characterised on agronomical, morphological and contextual variables selected from in-depth spatially explicit farm surveys. The model fostered a two-fold aim: to assess the farmers' decision criteria and predict miscanthus location probability. In addition, we evaluated the consequence of possible legislative constraints, which could prevent the miscanthus to be planted in protected areas or in place of grasslands. The small and complex-shaped farmer's blocks that were predicted by our model to be planted with miscanthus were also characterised by their great distance from the farm and the roads. This kind of result could provide a different perspective on the definition of ""marginal land"" by integrating also the farm management criteria. In conclusion, our approach elicited real farmers' criteria regarding miscanthus location to capture local specificities and explore different miscanthus location probabilities at the farm and landscape levels.

In order to understand general habitat preferences we modelled grey partridge and common pheasant densities over the entire range of Lower Saxony. Spatially explicit developments in bird densities were modelled using spatially explicit trends of crop cultivation. Pheasant and grey partridge densities counted annually by over 8000 hunting district holders over 10 years in a range of 3.7 Mio ha constitute a unique dataset (wildlife survey of Lower Saxony). Data on main landscape groups, functional groups of agricultural crops (consisting of 9.5 million fields compiled by the Integrated Administration and Control System) and landscape features were aggregated to 420 municipalities. To model linear 8 or 10 year population trends (for common pheasant and grey partridge respectively) we use rho correlation coefficients of densities, but also rho coefficients of agricultural crops.Results: All models confirm a dramatic decline in population densities. The habitat model for the grey partridge shows avoidance of municipalities with a high proportion of woodland and water areas, but a preference for areas with a high proportion of winter grains and high crop diversity. The trend model confirms these findings with a linear positive effect of diversity on grey partridge population development. Similarly, the pheasant avoids wooded areas but showed some preference for municipalities with open water. The effect of maize was found to be positive at medium densities, but negative at very high proportions. Winter grains, landscape features and high crop diversity are favorable. The positive effect of winter grains and higher crop diversity is also supported by the trend model.Conclusions: The results show the strong importance of diverse crop cultivation. Most incentives favor the cultivation of specific crops, which results in large areas of monocultures. The results confirm the importance of sustainable agricultural policies.","['Animals ; Biodiversity ; Crops, Agricultural/growt']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Heidi

A typology of farming systems was constructed to assess the more efficient type of farms in terms of “localisation within the agri-food system. The Saclay plateau has many assets to increase local agri-food system efficiency and to work towards “agricultural symbiosis”. However, a number of obstacles remain on both the production and the demand sides.

Animals may avoid agricultural management events and the changed habitat, to search for undisturbed areas or they might use and explore such areas due to beneficial changes in vegetation structure. Further, landscape structure might influence the movement processes that are underlying reactions to agricultural management. Here we study how agricultural management events affect animal movement behaviour in two contrastingly structured agricultural landscapes. In 2014 and 2015 we collared 36 European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) with GPS-tags and accelerometers in Northeast Germany (large agricultural fields) and South Germany (small fields and comparatively more non-arable vegetation). We recorded hares’ movement behaviour for 4 days before and after agricultural management events without (e.g. fertilizer application) and with (harvest and mowing) immediate changes in resource availability, on the most common production cover types (wheat, grasslands, maize and rapeseed). We measured the number of GPS points in the focal fields, the range size (area covered within 4 days), the shift in range centre, and the hares’ energy expenditure (overall dynamic body acceleration). More GPS locations were found on fields following management events that affected resource availability, and less GPS fixes were recorded on the wheat fields after management events without resource changes. Compared to an equivalent period without management events, hares showed increased range shifts after harvesting maize and rapeseed fields, mowing grasslands and after management events without resource changes for most of the production cover types. Range sizes were only affected in wheat fields in Northeast Germany, where they increased after harvest and decreased after management events without resource changes. Energy expenditure was unaffected by agricultural management. Hares may profit from harvested fields, likely because they find food in form of fallen grains, improve their predator detection probability and generally prefer areas with low vegetation. The reaction to management events without the change of resources might depend on the specific type of management practices (e.g. organic vs. inorganic fertilizer). Landscape structure may play an important role as range sizes increase due to the necessity to reach distant alternative habitats. Hence, the provision of smaller fields with high crop diversity and sufficient alternative habitat patches throughout the year has the potential to maximise accessible resources and predator detection ability for hares and other farmland wildlife.","['Energy expenditure', 'GPS', 'Germany', 'Landscape complexity', 'Radio tracking', 'Range shift', 'Resource change', 'Telemetry']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Heidi

For large regions, such as the whole EU, different approaches have been developed to address this problem, e.g. by downscaling economic model results to lower-level administrative regions or by spatially allocating farm types to homogenous spatial entities. For smaller regions and if interactions between farms have to be considered, these approaches are too coarse.Some studies make use of a synthetic landscape approach for this scale and type of analysis. Farms are placed on a grid of the area under study by ensuring that the localization of the farms fulfills the area claims of the farms. Available approaches use relatively simple techniques by considering only the grassland share in the total area of farms or farm types and use a relatively coarse resolution (1ha*1 ha). In this article, we present a method for improving the synthetic landscape approach, by considering landscape parameters in the allocation of farms, using a finer resolution (25 m*25 m) and introducing allocation quality indicators that allow for an assessment of the overall allocation result. For the German case study region Ostprignitz-Ruppin (NUT3 administrative level), the approach delivered a relatively high overall allocation quality. We conclude that the farm maps generated by our method can be used by mathematical optimization models or agent-based models to improve their capability of simulating spatial decisions and effects. The transferability of the method to other regions is possible, subject to data availability and the type of analysis targeted.

The existing foodshed approaches enable one to assess the theoretical capacity of the food self-sufficiency of a specific region, but they struggle to consider the diversity of existing crops in a way that could be usable to inform decisions and support urban food strategies. Most studies are based on the definition of the area required to meet local consumption, obtaining a map represented as an isotropic circle around the city, without considering the site-specific pedoclimatic, geographical, and socioeconomic conditions which are essential for the development of local food supply chains. In this study, we propose a first stage to fill this gap by combining the Metropolitan Foodshed and Self-sufficiency Scenario model, which already considers regional yields and specific land use covers, with spatially-explicit data on the cropping patterns, soil and topography. We use the available Europe-wide data and apply the methodology in the city region of Avignon (France), initially considering a foodshed with a radius of 30 km. Our results show that even though a theoretically-high potential self-sufficiency could be achieved for all of the food commodities consumed (>80%), when the specific pedological conditions of the area are considered, this could be suitable only for domestic plant-based products, whereas an expansion of the initial foodshed to a radius of 100 km was required for animal products to provide >70% self-sufficiency. We conclude that it is necessary to shift the analysis from the size assessment to the commodity-group–specific spatial configuration of the foodshed based on biophysical and socioeconomic features, and discuss avenues for further research to enable the development of a foodshed assessment as a complex of complementary pieces, i.e., the ‘foodshed archipelago’.","['Agricultural development', 'Agricultural diversification', 'Agricultural production', 'Agriculture', 'Altitude', 'Animal products', 'Archipelagoes', 'COVID-19', 'Commodities', 'Consumption', 'Cropping systems', 'Diet', 'Farms', 'Food', 'Food chains', 'Food supply', 'France', 'Land use', 'Livestock', 'Self sufficiency', 'Socio-economic aspects', 'Socioeconomics', 'Soil fertility', 'Supply chains', 'Urban areas', 'agricultural diversification', 'archipelago', 'city region', 'food modelling', 'food planning', 'food security', 'food self-sufficiency', 'foodshed', 'regional food system', 'self-reliance']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Heidi

However, rapid urbanisation and global agricultural restructuring constituting complex processes across multiple scales tend to threaten the survival of peri-urban agriculture. Focusing on family farms near Gothenburg in Sweden, this paper intends to explore the relations between location and agriculture and how family farms have been able to continue farming in peri-urban areas. Unlike previous studies of peri-urban agriculture, mostly carried out by planners from an urban-centric perspective, this paper deploys a rural and place-based perspective by drawing on theories of agricultural location. Based on statistical and spatial analyses of land use change, and interviews with farmers and authorities, the processes and drivers of local agricultural change are analysed. The results identify four simultaneous processes that produce the diversity in forms of agriculture between farms: structural changes, loss of farmland to urban expansion, specialisation of on-farm activities and a niching trend of on-farm activities. The new findings which shed light on the theory of agricultural localisation are: 1) niche production greatly takes advantage of the peri-urban location; 2) a reverse von Thünen's transportation pattern is enabled by the proximity to urban consumers; 3) enhancing competitive advantage through saving labour costs is enabled by the direct relation to consumers at the peri-urban location; 4) multifunctional agriculture has potential but also raises conflicts between different types of land use in peri-urban areas; 5) a secured access to land for farmers enabled by the local governance which separates the increasing land value from land rent is fundamental for supporting continued peri-urban agriculture. Our recommendation is that policy makers need to shift to a location-sensitive governing praxis of agriculture in order to re-vitalise peri-urban areas.","['Agricultural location', 'Agricultural transitions', 'Family farms', 'Land tenure', 'Peri-urban agriculture', 'von Thünen']",yes,yes,SE,Yes,no,,Heidi

The results show a steady decrease of willow plantations in recent years, which can be explained by changes in the policy framework (after 1996) and the increase in cereal prices (after 2007). The decline is partially offset by the establishment of new poplar and hybrid aspen plantations. New plantations tend to spread in southern areas; willow tends to be planted on higher productivity agricultural areas, and poplar on less productive land. There is a trend towards preferring smaller plantations (<1 ha) versus large ones (>10 ha). Although many willow plantations have been established on previous cereal land (particularly on spring barley and winter wheat), this pattern changed after 2007, preferring grasses and fallow land. The latter is the most common land use replaced by poplar plantations.

To this end the EU and many other countries and international organisations have committed significant resources to support land administration, and particularly cadastral projects, in Central Europe since 1992. This paper reviews the role that the establishment of land administration systems is playing in the accession of CEC to the EU. Other key requirements for accession to the EU are the adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy, the protection of human rights, environmental sustainability and institution building. The paper also considers the role that land administration plays in supporting these objectives and develops a generic framework for land administration projects in support of accession to the EU. As background the paper uses examples to highlight the historical context of land, the evolution of land administration in Central Europe, the reconstruction of property rights and the justification of land administration projects in the context of AGENDA 2000 for a wider Europe.

However, only a small fraction. of Austrian cash-crop farms follows organic production practices. This study analyses the effects of a widespread conversion to organic farming in the Weinviertel, a region dominated by field crops, on the production program, the quantities produced and the direct payment measures. Farms typical for the region were identified using the IACS data. Through linear planning models scenarios were calculated based on various assumptions regarding product prices and environmental protection requirements. Given the current prices for organic products, the results show that, despite the lower yields, the value of the produce increases, as does the total gross margin of the farm types considered in the study. Despite direct payments for organic farming, however without price premiums for organic products, several farm types face lower gross margins than under conventional production practices. If the price premiums can be sustained even after the widespread conversion to organic farming, the increase in total gross margin of the region is higher than the increase in direct payment requirements. Additional environmental protection measures, which are included in one scenario, result in lower total gross margins even if the price premiums for organic products can be maintained.

Most research is still mostly relying on optical satellite imagery for these tasks, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is often neglected. Therefore, this research assessed the classification accuracy using the recent Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data for LC mapping, especially vegetation classes. Additionally, ancillary data, such as texture features, spectral indices from S1 and S2, respectively, as well as digital elevation model (DEM), were used in different classification scenarios. Random Forest (RF) was used for classification tasks using a proposed hybrid reference dataset derived from European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS), CORINE, and Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) LC database. Based on the RF variable selection using Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), the combination of S1 and S2 data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 91.78%, with a total disagreement of 8.22%. The most pertinent features for vegetation mapping were GLCM Mean and Variance for S1, NDVI, along with Red and SWIR band for S2, whereas the digital elevation model produced major classification enhancement as an input feature. The results of this study demonstrated that the aforementioned approach (i.e., RF using a hybrid reference dataset) is well-suited for vegetation mapping using Sentinel imagery, which can be applied for large-scale LC classifications.

They provide travel distances of some hundreds meters over hydraulically rough, flat-bottomed surfaces. Studies in small watersheds (<100ha) have demonstrated a large reduction in runoff volume and peak discharge but it is unknown to who extent large watersheds (>1000ha) also benefit from these effects, when land uses other than arable land also contribute and when travel time increases due to the increasing flow path length. We analyzed this by a modeling approach because controlled experiments can hardly be applied for large watersheds. Two summers, one prior to and one after small grain harvest, and one winter condition and recurrence times of 2, 10, 20 and 50yr were taken into account. Land use was assumed to be either dominated by arable land (80%) or varying between sub-watersheds with arable land contributing only 45% on average. Under predominantly arable land use 2.3% of the total land was found suitable to be converted to GWWs, while for a diversified land use only 0.8% of the total land called for a GWW. For all conditions the efficacy of GWWs to reduce runoff volume and peak discharge decreased only slightly with increasing watershed size. Under arable land use and summer conditions-runoff volume was reduced by about 30% and peak discharge by about 40% with somewhat higher values for more frequent storms and lower values for rare storms. The efficacy was considerably lower under winter conditions and for a diversified land use where only a small proportion of GWWs was assumed. Runoff reduction was affected more and may drop below 5% under unfavorable conditions (low GWW percentage, winter, large events) while still a reduction in peak discharge of at least 15% was observed even under most of the unfavorable conditions despite a loss of land of only 0.8%. GWWs hence contribute considerably to flood control even in watersheds larger than 1000ha and especially when summer floods are the main problem.","['Agricultural watersheds', 'Grassed waterway', 'Runoff control', 'Scale effects']",yes,no,DE,yes,yes,not plot,Heidi

Landscape pattern indices (LPIs), such as mean patch size and number of patches, are routinely used to quantify fragmentation and are often calculated using remote-sensing imagery that has been classified into different land-cover classes. No classified map is ever completely correct, so we asked if different maps with similar misclassification rates could result in widely different errors in pattern indices. We simulated landscapes with varying proportions of habitat and clumpiness (autocorrelation) and then simulated classification errors on the same maps. We simulated higher misclassification at patch edges (as is often observed), and then used a smoothing algorithm routinely used on images to correct salt-and-pepper classification error. We determined how well classification errors (and smoothing) corresponded to errors seen in four pattern indices. Maps with low misclassification rates often yielded errors in LPIs of much larger magnitude and substantial variability. Although smoothing usually improved classification error, it sometimes increased LPI error and reversed the direction of error in LPIs introduced by misclassification. Our results show that classification error is not always a good predictor of errors in LPIs, and some types of image postprocessing (for example, smoothing) might result in the underestimation of habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is potential for large errors in nearly every landscape pattern analysis ever published, because virtually none quantify the errors in LPIs themselves.

These scenarios are assessed through combined biophysical and economic approaches. Two scenarios for the disappearance of dairy farming are chosen. One scenario has no public-action program (StopMilk), while the other one has a program based on the funding of best management practices (StopMilk-E). These scenarios are assessed at the small watershed scale (7 km2) in terms of both changes in farming systems and effects on runoff (use of the STREAM model). Finally, the economic evaluation of additional costs of StopMilk-E is extrapolated at the level of the Austreberthe watershed syndicate (214 km2), using the French Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) with a spatially referenced database of cropping plans. StopMilk leads to a significant increase in runoff whereas the local public-action program proposed under StopMilk-E reduces runoff to below the 2007 level.

As a result, it is dependent on oil, which may start to decline in production in the 2020s, thus exposing the agricultural sector to potential economic stress, including increased input prices and decreased farmer purchase capacities. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the capacity of European farming systems (FS) to maintain production levels despite a decline in oil production (i.e., robustness). OBJECTIVE We aimed to model and compare the time variations in the animal- and crop-sourced production of three French FS under three scenarios of decreased availability of feed and synthetic fertiliser imports. METHODS We developed a FS-scale dynamic model that considers nitrogen flows between livestock, plant, and soil compartments. Plant production is a function of soil mineral nitrogen levels, and livestock numbers depend on feed availability. The three FS are characterised by different crop-grassland-livestock balances: (i) field crop (Plateau Picard), (ii) intensive monogastric (Bretagne Centrale), and (iii) extensive ruminant (Bocage Bourbonnais). The three scenarios consist of different combinations of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers and feed import availability declines until 2050: a decrease in synthetic fertilisers only (Synth-), a decrease in feed imports (Feed-), and a decrease in both external inputs (Synth-Feed-). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The first two scenarios highlight the positive role of livestock effluents and permanent grasslands on the robustness of food production. In the Synth-Feed- scenario, the extensive ruminant FS exhibits robustness (no decline in food production) for 13 years, whereas the field crop FS exhibits robustness for 4 years. In contrast, the intensive monogastric FS shows decreased food production within the first year. The difference between the two crop-livestock FS can be explained by livestock density, herd composition but also plant cover composition. In the long term, all three FS show a decrease in food production between 45 and 60%. SIGNIFICANCE Our modelling work shed some light on the role of ruminants and permanent grasslands in making FS more robust to decreases in synthetic fertiliser and feed import availability, increasing the time without production decline after the beginning of the perturbation. For longer-time resilience, configurational changes are still necessary, however a greater robustness gives more time to implement them, therefore facilitating adaptation and transformation. Our model paves the way to the study of resilience of FS from the point of view of their crop-grassland-livestock configuration and their dependence on external inputs.","['Dynamic model', 'Farming system', 'Global peak oil', 'Nitrogen flows', 'Resilience', 'Robustness']",yes,no,FR,Yes,yes,not plot,Heidi

The interaction of legumes with other crops (rotational effects) requires an assessment at the cropping system scale. The objective of this work is to introduce a cropping system framework to assess the impacts of changes in cropping systems in a participatory approach with experts, i.e., the integration of legumes into crop rotations and to demonstrate its application in two case studies. The framework consists of a rule-based rotation generator and a set of algorithms to calculate impact indicators. It follows a three-step approach: (i) generate rotations, (ii) evaluate crop production activities using environmental, economic and phytosanitary indicators, and (iii) design cropping systems and assess their impacts. Experienced agronomists and environmental scientists were involved at several stages of the framework development and testing in order to ensure the practicability of designed cropping systems. The framework was tested in Västra Götaland (Sweden) and Brandenburg (Germany) by comparing cropping systems with and without legumes. In both case studies, cropping systems with legumes reduced nitrous oxide emissions with comparable or slightly lower nitrate-N leaching, and had positive phytosanitary effects. In arable systems with grain legumes, gross margins were lower than in cropping systems without legumes despite taking pre-crop effects into account. Forage cropping systems with legumes had higher or equivalent gross margins and at the same time higher environmental benefits than cropping systems without legumes. The framework supports agronomists to design sustainable legume-supported cropping systems and to assess their impacts.","['Expert knowledge', 'Land use change impacts', 'Multi-criteria', 'Protein crops', 'Resource-efficiency', 'Rotation generator']",no,no,"DE, SE",yes,yes,data,Heidi

To assess the relevance of the modifying areal unit problem (MAUP), we investigated as to how a change in the data resolution regarding both soil and land use data influences the results obtained for different land use indicators. For the assessment we use the example of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculturally used organic soils (mainly fens and bogs). Although less than 5 % of the German agricultural area in use is located on organic soils, the drainage of these areas to enable their agricultural utilization causes roughly 37 % of the GHG emissions of the German agricultural sector. The abandonment of the cultivation and rewetting of organic soils would be an effective policy to reduce national GHG emissions. To assess the abatement costs, it is essential to know which commodities, and at what quantities, are actually produced on this land. Furthermore, in order to limit windfall profits, information on the differences of the profitability among farms are needed. However, high-resolution data regarding land use and soil characteristics are often not available, and their generation is costly or the access is strictly limited because of legal constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse how indicators for land use on organic soils respond to changes in the spatial aggregation of the data. In Germany, organic soils are predominantly used for forage cropping. Marked differences between the various regions of Germany are apparent with respect to the dynamics and the intensity of land use. Data resolution mainly impairs the derived extent of agriculturally used peatland and the observed intensity gradient, while its impact on the average value for the investigated set of land-use indicators is generally minor.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","['22131:Water Supply and Irrigation Systems', '54162:Environmental Consulting Services', 'Agriculture', 'Agriculture -- standards', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Carbon Dioxide -- analysis', 'Carbon Footprint', 'Environmental Monitoring -- methods', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental management', 'Farms', 'Germany', 'Grasslands', 'Greenhouse effect', 'Greenhouse gases', 'Land use', 'Maps as Topic', 'Mineralization', 'Peatlands', 'Soil', 'Soil -- chemistry', 'Soil -- standards', 'Soils']",no,no,DE,yes,yes,data,Heidi

The pollen loads of the colonies contained variable shares of sorghum pollen ranging between approx. 10% and 50% (weight/weight). Sorghum pollen occurred frequently in more than 50% of all pollen samples.

However, exploiting openly available remote sensing imagery (e.g., from the European Union’s Copernicus programme) may allow for frequent and efficient field mapping with minimal human interaction. We present a new approach to extracting agricultural fields at the sub-pixel level. It consists of boundary detection and a field polygon extraction step based on a newly developed, modified version of the growing snakes active contours model we refer to as graph-based growing contours. This technique is capable of extracting complex networks of boundaries present in agricultural landscapes, and is largely automatic with little supervision required. The whole detection and extraction process is designed to work independently of sensor type, resolution, or wavelength.

These core values are reflected in the changing Common Agricultural Policy. This policy is one of the key drivers of agricultural practice across the EU, as it has become more oriented towards the concepts of sustainability in recent years. The EU operates a farm-level monitoring system, the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN), which acts as a check to establish if such successful change is being achieved, currently the primary focus is on the economic dimension of sustainability. We argue that to complement existing monitoring tools, cost-effective measurement of indicators for other sustainability dimensions a the farm scale is required.This article explores to what extent EU agricultural beneficiaries data as collected under the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) can be a complementary source of information for this task. To this end, candidate indicators for the environmental dimension from available studies were reviewed and it was assessed whether the data requirements for the indicators could be ma through IACS data.The identified five environmental indicators were produced from an IACS data set from Germany.The indicator data was quantitatively analysed and compared with target values reported in the literature, and interpreted with regard to meaningfulness and possible improvements. Our results show that IACS data is indeed a potential source for farm level indicators for the environmental dimension, primarily with regard to landscape diversity (landscape features, parcel size) and the diversity of crop production. The spatial nature of IACS allows for a link to other environmental data and to agroecosystem models which may provide additional indicators, e.g. nutrient balances. However, important information on management of field operations and livestock herds is still insufficient in both FADN and IACS.

We found that pollination success and the proportion of fully pollinated berries were higher on organic compared to conventional farms and this difference was already evident 2–4 years after conversion to organic farming.

Predicting the effects of a range of possible LUCCs helps local authorities choose policies that can help to mitigate the risks to which local populations are exposed. In this article we build scenarios for changes in farming systems, with a 2015 horizon and with 2007 as the initial situation. These scenarios are assessed through combined biophysical and economic approaches. Two scenarios for the disappearance of dairy farming are chosen. One scenario has no public-action program (StopMilk), while the other one has a program based on the funding of best management practices (StopMilk-E). These scenarios are assessed at the small watershed scale (7km2) in terms of both changes in farming systems and effects on runoff (use of the STREAM model). Finally, the economic evaluation of additional costs of StopMilk-E is extrapolated at the level of the Austreberthe watershed syndicate (214km2), using the French Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) with a spatially referenced database of cropping plans. StopMilk leads to a significant increase in runoff whereas the local public-action program proposed under StopMilk-E reduces runoff to below the 2007 level. The Austreberthe watershed residentsâ willingness to pay for a 15-year program is around â395,000/year, which is not sufficient to balance the cost of the modified farming practices (â640,000/year over the first 3 years).

We develop an integrated modelling framework to compute stochastic Pareto frontiers using realizations of three climate scenarios (SIMILAR, DRY, WET) for the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria. The stochastic Pareto frontiers relate net benefits of agricultural production (NB) to three environmental goal indicators including groundwater extraction (GWEX), nitrate leaching (NO3), and topsoil organic carbon stocks (SOC). The simulation results depict trade-offs and environmental co-benefits depending on the climate scenario and induced land use changes. A 1% (or 20%) decline of NB reduces GWEX by 11–83% (or 61–100%) and NO3 by 18–19% (or 49–53%), and increases SOC by 1% (or 5%), depending on the climate scenario. The results also reveal some environmental co-benefits for all Pareto frontier combinations. Climate change intensifies or alleviates trade-offs between NB and environmental goal indicators: in a dry climate scenario, trade-offs between NB and GWEX as well as SOC increase, while in a wet climate scenario, trade-offs between NB and NO3 increase. Overall, we find that efficient climate change adaptation of land use and management practices significantly improves the environmental outcomes for fairly small reductions in agricultural net benefits.","['Agro-environmental indicators', 'Climate change', 'Efficiency frontier', 'Integrated modelling', 'Trade-off analysis']",no,no,AT,yes,yes,,Henning

We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R=0.98; RRMSE=14%) and yield (R=0.81; RRMSE=8.9%), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R=0.96; RRMSE=4.6%). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing.

In this study, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated for mainland France from multispectral imagery. For 67% and 84% of the area under spring-sown crops for years 2018 and 2019, soil cover during the previous winter was estimated through the computation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using Sentinel-2 multispectral images. At country scale, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated between 37% and 48% for 2018 and between 31% and 43% for 2019, depending on the NDVI threshold for a soil to be considered covered by at least 50% of vegetation. Spatial patterns were relatively similar between the two years studied, highlighting strong heterogeneities between French departments. Cropping systems may explain some of these heterogeneities, as it has been shown that there is a large variability in the soil cover rate between spring-sown crops, but also depending on the previous crop. Winter soil cover rate was higher for crops associated with livestock production, such as maize silage (between 59% and 74% of plots covered before this crop). It was also shown that winter soil cover could be ensured by other means than cover crops: temporary grasslands were the previous crop with the highest soil cover, probably due to late ploughing. For these reasons, mixed systems combining livestock and crop productions may be a solution to increase winter soil cover before spring-sown crops.","['Agricultural practices', 'Agricultural production', 'Cover crops', 'Cropping systems', 'Crops', 'Environmental Studies', 'France', 'Grasslands', 'Livestock', 'Rain', 'Satellite imagery', 'Soils', 'Spring', 'Vegetation', 'Vegetation index', 'Winter']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Henning

At the same time, the awareness and demand of consumers for regional food is constantly rising, in particular in urban regions. The resulting challenge is that high demand for regional food is concentrated at places where land for food production tends to be particularly under pressure. Against this background, our article reflects on the extent to which regional food supply chains support the status of agricultural demand in the competition for land. The main aim of our paper is to understand the role of proximity between the different stages of value creation, including cultivation, production (manual or industrial) and trade (retail, direct marketing). Our empirical study on the example of three products in Bavaria (Germany) shows that short distances within food value chains support the agricultural condition in land use dynamics (beer, sweet cherry, asparagus). The analyses are based on official and internal statistics as well as expert interviewing. This mixed-methods approach results in value-creation mappings and provides spatial differentiation of the economic process. Proximity between at least two stages of value creation plays an important role to explain the economic trends and land use dynamic. These findings are rooted in arguments of efficiency, tacit knowledge, networks, as well as product reputation. However, the role of proximity does not automatically play a role but has to be stabilized by strategic measures such as product innovation and marketing measures.","['Agricultural land', 'Agriculture', 'Beer', 'Chain dynamics', 'Conservation', 'Economics', 'Empirical analysis', 'Farms', 'Food', 'Food chains', 'Food production', 'Food products', 'Food supply', 'Geography', 'Land use', 'Marketing', 'Proximity', 'Supply chains', 'Sustainable development', 'Urban areas', 'Value added', 'Value chain', 'Value creation', 'economic geography', 'food geography', 'local food', 'regional value creation', 'short food supply chains']",yes,no,GE,yes,yes,,Henning

However, agricultural land fragmentation is dealt with in only a few such studies. We have investigated the effects of ownership and soil quality on agricultural land fragmentation in the highly fragmented ownership patterns that characterize some of the transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Using patch-scale spatial data generated from GIS, Minimal Adequate Models, based on ANOVA, were performed to test for the effects of ownership and soil quality patterns on arable land and grassland fragmentation across 483 study areas. The results show that there are important differences in the predictors of fragmentation between arable land and grassland. Grassland fragmentation was found to be associated particularly with ownership fragmentation, whereas arable land fragmentation tended to be driven mainly by soil conditions. A higher proportion of public ownership supports the more frequent appearance of larger patches. We found a significantly positive relationship between natural soil fertility and arable land fragmentation, while there was a strongly negative relationship between natural soil fertility and grassland fragmentation. Soil quality diversity was observed to be the most important driver affecting arable land fragmentation, but only a non-significant driver of grassland fragmentation. The study provides arguments for intervention aimed at reducing the huge differences between the levels of land-ownership and the land-use fragmentation.

In the European Union (EU), societal demands to include environmental conservation concerns within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have resulted in the recognition of the importance of maintaining High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf).HNVf constitute complex social-ecological systems, which owe their nature conservation value to the maintenance of specific, mostly low-intensity farming systems, supporting high levels of species and habitats dependent on agricultural practices. Even though HNVf assessment in space and time is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of Rural Development Programmes, the diversity of rural landscapes across EU, the scarcity of data on farming systems, and the lack of common methodological guidelines has hampered the implementation of HNVf mapping and monitoring across Europe. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and test methodological approaches that may support HNVf assessment across the EU.The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) which is mandatory for all EU Member States constitutes a system for the management and control of CAP payments to farmers. Essentially, IACS comprises high-resolution, spatially explicit information on the type and intensity of agricultural land-use. Even though such data exhibits high thematic, spatial and temporal resolution, IACS has seldom been used, due to significant access restrictions. Here, the potential to use IACS data to support the assessment of HNVf was evaluated within the German Federal State of Lower Saxony by implementing a recently developed methodological framework. Sets of indicators known to be essential for identifying potential HNVf and underlying farming systems (expressing landscape structure and composition, farming systems, and crop diversity), were derived from IACS. Spatial patterns of indicators were analyzed at two different scales to delineate the potential distribution of HNVf across Lower Saxony.Results highlighted that most regions in Lower Saxony were characterized by intensive farming practices including high livestock density, high share of intensive crops and low density of linear elements. Only 3% of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) of Lower Saxony potentially constituted HNVf, with the majority of HNVf coinciding with mosaics of arable and/or permanent crops and semi-natural features under less intensive farming practices. Semi-natural grasslands, partially under agri-environment scheme management contracts, covered roughly 1% of the UAA and were mostly intermingled with other farmland habitats in extensively managed agricultural landscapes.In the context of the EU-wide HNVf assessment, IACS constitutes an important source of data, characterized by a high spatial, thematic and temporal resolution of data collected annually. Whilst having the potential for use in HNVf assessment, some challenges remain, especially due to significant access restrictions. Nevertheless, IACS constitutes a powerful tool to evaluate the extent and condition of HNVf across the EU countryside. Making use of IACS data in such a way could provide a stepping-stone towards achieving a more effective balance between the management and control of CAP support payments and the growing societal demands related to the maintenance and enhancement of farmland biodiversity and ecosystem services.",['agricultural land ; biodiversity ; Common Agricult'],yes,yes,GE,yes,no,,Henning

To quantify map discrepancies, we used the structural similarity index (SSIM) and analyzed the differences in local mean, variance and covariance between the maps. We found that using different spatial resolutions led to a relatively small difference in the outcomes, in which regulation and maintenance services are more affected than the other services categories.

We tested implications of GM OSR application for biodiesel production in Austria by means of high resolution spatially explicit simulation of 140 different coexistence scenarios within six main OSR cropping regions in Austria (2400 km2). We identified structural land use characteristics such as field size, land use diversity, land holding patterns and the proportion of the target crop as the predominant factors which influence overall production of OSR in a coexistence scenario. Assuming isolation distances of 800 m and non-GM-OSR proportions of at least 10% resulted in a loss of area for cultivation of OSR in all study areas ranging from −4.5% to more than −25%, depending on the percentage of GM farmers and on the region. We could show that particularly the current primary OSR cropping regions are largely unsuitable for coexistence and would suffer from a net loss of OSR area even at isolation distances of 400 or 800 m. Coexistence constraints associated with application of GM OSR are likely to offset possible GM gains by substantially reducing farmland for OSR cultivation, thus contradicting the political aim to increase domestic OSR area to meet the combined demands of food, feed and biofuel production.","['Biofuel', 'Coexistence', 'GMO', 'Landscape', 'Oilseed rape', 'Renewable energy directive']",yes,yes,AT,Yes,no,,Henning

By relating our results to patterns observed for species richness we show that: (1) species richness generally declines with decreasing landscape heterogeneity, but taxonomic breadth only declines with landscape heterogeneity on conventionally managed farms. We further highlight the importance to provide results of species composition analyses as (2) primarily hoverfly species benefited from organic farming, but three bee species from different families were favoured by conventionally managed farms and (3) two hoverfly species with aphidophagous larvae showed contrasting responses to landscape heterogeneity. These results advance the understanding of how landscape heterogeneity and farming practices alter insect communities and further suggest that diversity patterns need to be analysed beyond species richness to fully uncover consequences of agricultural intensification. Zusammenfassung Der Einfluss der Heterogenität von Landschaften und der Bewirtschaftungsform auf die Artenzusammensetzung von Gemeinschaften ist allgemein weniger gut verstanden als deren Auswirkung auf die Artenzahl. Die Zusammensetzung von Bestäubergemeinschaften ist jedoch eine wichtige Eigenschaft welche ökosystemare Dienstleistungen wie z.B. die Bestäubung von Pflanzen durch Insekten beeinflussen kann. In dieser Studie wurde der Effekt der ökologischen und konventionellen Bewirtschaftung und unterschiedlicher Landschaftskomplexität auf die Artenzahl, Artenzusammensetzung und taxonomische Breite von Bestäubergemeinschaften untersucht. Aus dem Vergleich dieser Ergebnisse ergaben sich folgende Schlussfolgerungen: (1) die Artenzahl nimmt generell mit abnehmender Heterogenität der Landschaften ab, die taxonomische Breite einer Gemeinschaft nimmt jedoch nur unter konventioneller Bewirtschaftung ab. Es zeigten sich deutliche Unterschiede zwischen den analysierten Gruppen, da (2) hauptsächlich Schwebfliegenarten von der ökologischen Bewirtschaftung profitierten, wohingegen drei Bienenarten von konventioneller Bewirtschaftung profitierten. Zwei Schwebfliegenarten mit aphidophagen Larven zeigten gegensätzliche Antworten auf eine zunehmende Heterogenität der Landschaft. Diese Ergebnisse tragen zu einem verbesserten Verständnis darüber bei, wie die Heterogenität von Landschaften und die Bewirtschaftungsform auf die Artenzusammensetzung von Insektengemeinschaften wirken. Des Weiteren wird gezeigt, dass Biodiversitätsstudien neben der Artenzahl auch die Artenzusammensetzung berücksichtigen sollten, da nur auf diese Weise die Auswirkungen der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung in vollem Umfang deutlich werden.","['Agri-environment schemes', 'Agricultural intensification', 'Landscape context', 'Landscape ecology', 'Pollinators']",yes,yes,SE,Yes,no,,Henning

Here, we develop a novel method for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing parameters derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. We link crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from time-series of a two-band enhanced vegetation index with biodiversity indicators (insect pollinators and insect-pollinated vascular plants) in agricultural fields in southern Sweden, with contrasting land management (i.e. conventional and organic farming). Our results show that arable land-use intensity in cereal systems dominated by spring-sown cereals can be approximated using Sentinel-2 productivity parameters. This was shown by the significant positive correlations between the amplitude and maximum value of the enhanced vegetation index on one side and farmer reported yields on the other. We also found that conventional cereal fields had 17% higher maximum and 13% higher amplitude of their enhanced vegetation index than organic fields. Sentinel-2 derived parameters were more strongly correlated with the abundance and species richness of bumblebees and the richness of vascular plants than the abundance and species richness of butterflies. The relationships we found between biodiversity and crop production proxies are consistent with predictions that increasing agricultural land-use intensity decreases field biodiversity. The newly developed method based on crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from Sentinel-2 data serves as a proof of concept for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity over cereal fields across larger areas. It enables the estimation of arable productivity in cereal systems, which can then be used by ecologists and develop tools for land managers as a proxy for land-use intensity. Coupled with spatially explicit databases on agricultural land-use, this method will enable crop-specific cereal productivity estimation across large geographical regions.","['Agriculture', 'Crop biomass', 'Land-use intensity', 'Phenology', 'Pollinators', 'Sentinel-2']",yes,yes,SE,Yes,no,,Henning

Such maps are useful for water management. The recent availability of optical and radar image time series such as the Sentinel data offers new opportunities to map land cover with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Early identification of irrigated crops is of major importance for irrigation scheduling, but the cloud coverage might significantly reduce the number of available optical images, making crop identification difficult. SAR image time series such as those provided by Sentinel-1 offer the possibility of improving early crop mapping. This paper studies the impact of the Sentinel-1 images when used jointly with optical imagery (Landsat8) and a digital elevation model of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The study site is located in a temperate zone (southwest France) with irrigated maize crops. The classifier used is the Random Forest. The combined use of the different data (radar, optical, and SRTM) improves the early classifications of the irrigated crops (k = 0.89) compared to classifications obtained using each type of data separately (k = 0.84). The use of the DEM is significant for the early stages but becomes useless once crops have reached their full development. In conclusion, compared to a “full optical” approach, the “combined” method is more robust over time as radar images permit cloudy conditions to be overcome.","['Accuracy', 'Cereal crops', 'Classification', 'Climate change', 'Corn', 'Crop identification', 'Crops', 'Digital Elevation Models', 'Digital imaging', 'France', 'Irrigation', 'Irrigation scheduling', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Landsat', 'Landsat satellites', 'Landsat-8', 'Mapping', 'Maps', 'Physics', 'Radar', 'Radar imaging', 'Random Forest', 'Remote sensing', 'Seasons', 'Sentinel-2', 'Studies', 'Time series', 'Vegetation', 'Water management', 'irrigated crops', 'satellite image time series', 'seasonal crop mapping']",no,no,FR,Yes,yes,,Henning

However, the radical shift of the computer vision field away from hand-engineered image features and towards more automation by representation learning comes with many promises, including higher quality results and less engineering effort. In particular, convolutional neural networks learn features which take into account the context of the pixels and, therefore, a better representation of the data can be obtained. In this paper, we assess fully convolutional neural network architectures as replacements for a Random Forest classifier in an operational context for the production of high resolution land cover maps with Sentinel-2 time-series at the country scale. Our contributions include a framework for working with Sentinel-2 L2A time-series image data, an adaptation of the U-Net model (a fully convolutional neural network) for dealing with sparse annotation data while maintaining high resolution output, and an analysis of those results in the context of operational production of land cover maps.

Model validation and sensitivity analysis are conducted to reveal robustness and accuracy of model outputs as well as its appropriateness for supporting integrated land use analyses. Comparisons between modeled and observed crop sequences from seven years of field observations show that the average area-weighted deviations range between 11% and 105% depending on the procedure of comparison and model specifications.

Recent works have shown the capability of Sentinel-2 to predict SOC content over temperate agroecosystems characterized with annual crops. However, because spectral models are only applicable on bare soils, the mapping of SOC is often obtained on limited areas. A possible improvement for increasing the number of pixels on which SOC can be retrieved by inverting bare soil reflectance spectra, consists of using optical images acquired at several dates. This study compares different approaches of Sentinel–2 images temporal mosaicking to produce a composite multi-date bare soil image for predicting SOC content over agricultural topsoils. A first approach for temporal mosaicking was based on a per-pixel selection and was driven by soil surface characteristics: bare soil or dry bare soil with/without removing dry vegetation. A second approach for creating composite images was based on a per-date selection and driven either by the models performance from single-date, or by average soil surface indicators of bare soil or dry bare soil. To characterize soil surface, Sentinel-1 (S1)-derived soil moisture and/or spectral indices such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), bare soil index (BSI) and a soil surface moisture index (S2WI) were used either separately or in combination. This study highlighted the following results: i) none of the temporal mosaic images improved model performance for SOC prediction compared to the best single-date image; ii) of the per-pixel approaches, temporal mosaics driven by the S1-derived moisture content, and to a lesser extent, by NBR2 index, outperformed the mosaic driven by the BSI index but they did not increase the bare soil area predicted; iii) of the per-date approaches, the best trade-off between predicted area and model performance was achieved from the temporal mosaic driven by the S1-derived moisture content (R2 ~ 0.5, RPD ~ 1.4, RMSE ~ 3.7 g.kg-1) which enabled to more than double (*2.44) the predicted area. This study suggests that a number of bare soil mosaics based on several indicators (moisture, bare soil, roughness…), preferably in combination, might maintain acceptable accuracies for SOC prediction whilst extending over larger areas than single-date images.","['Croplands', 'Sentinel-2', 'Soil moisture', 'Soil organic carbon', 'Temporal mosaic']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Henning

Agroforestry, the combination of woody vegetation with crops and/or livestock, is expected to simultaneously increase provisioning and regulating ecosystem services, but knowledge gaps concerning trade-offs exist especially in temperate industrialized and alpine regions. Here, we quantify the aboveground carbon (C) dynamics of a hypothetical agroforestry implementation in the Austrian long-term socio-ecological research region Eisenwurzen from 2020 to 2050. We develop three land use scenarios to differentiate conventional agriculture from an immediate and a gradual agroforestry implementation, integrate data from three distinct models (Yield-SAFE, SECLAND, MIAMI), and advance the socio-ecological indicator framework Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP) to assess trade-offs between biomass provision and carbon sequestration. Results indicate that agroforestry strongly decreases HANPP because of a reduction in biomass harvest by up to &minus; 47% and a simultaneous increase in actual net primary production by up to 31%, with a large amount of carbon sequestered in perennial biomass by up to 3.4 t C ha-1 yr-1. This shows that a hypothetical transition to agroforestry in the Eisenwurzen relieves the agroecosystem from human-induced pressure but results in significant trade-offs between biomass provision and carbon sequestration. We thus conclude that while harvest losses inhibit large-scale implementation in intensively used agricultural regions, agroforestry constitutes a valuable addition to sustainable land use policy, in particular when affecting extensive pastures and meadows in alpine landscapes.","['Agricultural ecosystems', 'Agroforestry', 'Alpine regions', 'Biomass', 'Carbon', 'Carbon sequestration', 'Climate change', 'Ecosystem services', 'Environmental Studies', 'Human influences', 'Land use', 'Land use policy', 'Livestock', 'Long-term socio-ecological research (LTSER)', 'Meadows', 'Mountain agriculture', 'Mountains', 'Multi-functionality', 'Net Primary Productivity', 'Pasture', 'Primary production', 'Provisioning', 'Sustainable use', 'Tradeoffs', 'Woody plants']",yes,yes,AT,yes,no,,Henning

The aim of the study is, first, to calibrate a model to predict Champagne chalk groundwater level at Vailly (Grand-Est, France), and, second, to estimate related uncertainties, linked both to the spatial distribution of rainfalls and to the parameter initialization. The parameter uncertainties are assessed following a previous methodology, using nine mixed probability density functions (pdf), thus creating models of correctness. Spatial distribution of rainfall uncertainty is generated by swapping three rainfall inputs and then observing dispersion of 27 model outputs. This uncertainty is incorporated into models of correctness. We show that, in this case study, an ensemble model of 40 different initializations is sufficient to estimate parameter uncertainty while preserving quality. Logistic, Gumbel and Raised Cosine laws fit the distribution of increasing and decreasing groundwater levels well, which then allows the establishment of models of correctness. These models of correctness provide a confidence interval associated with the forecasts, with an arbitrary degree of confidence chosen by the user. These methodologies have proved to have significant advantages: the rigorous design of the neural network model has allowed the realisation of models able to generalize outside of the range of the data used for training.

The Catchment Characterisation Tool (CCT) is a GIS-based model developed to assess the potential risk posed by nitrate and phosphate from diffuse agricultural sources to surface water and groundwater by delineating critical source areas in Irish sub-catchments. The CCT model results have been generated to support pressure-impact assessments following the source-pathway-receptor concept to target local catchment stream walks in areas where the potential impact may be higher. These risk maps can be used at a maximum scale of 1:25,000 (e.g. water body scale) to target areas for Local Catchment Assessments and are not designed or suitable to be used on their own as a basis for decisions at local or field scale. Consequently, these maps act as signposts for where further characterisation and engagement actions should be prioritised. This paper details the model structure and data requirements for the CCT for nitrate followed by validation of the results by comparing a national dataset of measured nitrate concentrations in Irish water bodies with values predicted by the CCT. The model performed well at predicting the annual average nitrate concentrations, with surface waters showing better correlation with CCT predictions than for groundwater.

Scattered, excessively small parcels cease to be viable for individual farming, and owners feel forced to rent these parcels to larger enterprises farming on adjacent land. Our study demonstrates a phenomenon that we call the Farmland Rental Paradox, where very small parcels tend to create large production blocks by being rented to larger farmers, and therefore to significantly homogenize the land-use pattern. The parcel size established as the threshold for this phenomenon is 1.07 ha. Below this threshold, the smaller the parcels were, the larger the blocks that they tended to create. Using the example of the Czech Republic, a state with extremely high farmland ownership fragmentation, it is demonstrated that this phenomenon can currently determine the land use of up to 40% of the country's farmland. Our study also points to other countries where this phenomenon may apply, especially the transitional countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The study discusses the tempo of the fragmentation process, which accelerates exponentially in countries with the equal inheritance system. It goes on to discuss defragmentation, social impacts of the dominance of the land rental market, and environmental impacts of significant homogenization of the land-use pattern.

Potential is determined for the defined area using a bottom-up approach where these yields are derived in relation to climate and soil conditions of each land plot of agricultural and forest land. Results of methodology testing have proven that biomass potential from agriculture and forest land can be significantly increased in the short run (typically from 18% up to 40% in our case studies depending on biomass source and region). There are three major sources of additional biomass potential: reduction of straw ploughed into soil, changes in utilization of harvested timber from forests and shortening of rotation of SRC plantations.

To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders (> 160 m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site (> 160 m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes. Our results show that while decreasing landscape heterogeneity may impair pollination in homogeneous landscapes, this can be locally mitigated by sowing flower strips.

The proportional abundance of bumblebee species with small foraging ranges was lower at honeybee sites than at control sites in heterogeneous landscapes, whereas bumblebee communities in homogeneous landscapes were dominated by a single species with long foraging range irrespective of if honeybees were added or not. We conclude that honeybees can impact bumblebee densities, but that landscape heterogeneity modified this effect. Zusammenfassung Honigbienen können Wildbienen durch Konkurrenz verdrängen, indem sie häufige Ressourcen erschöpfen, was möglicherweise häufiger in einfach strukturierten Landschaften geschieht, in denen blütenreiche Habitate verloren gegangen sind. Wir testeten dies, indem wir experimentell Bienenstöcke an neun Standorten hinzufügten und in zehn weiteren sicherstellten, dass keine Bienenstöcke vorhanden waren. Die Landschaften, die die geographisch voneinander getrennten Standorte umgaben, enthielten entweder einen geringen (homogene Landschaft) oder einen hohen (heterogene Landschaft) Anteil von naturnahem Grasland. In homogenen Landschaften reduzierte die Hinzugabe von Honigbienen die Hummeldichten in Feldrainen und im Straßenbegleitgrün, während in heterogenen Landschaften kein derartiger Effekt beobachtet werden konnte. In heterogenen Landschaften war der proportionale Anteil von Hummelarten mit kleinem Sammelaktionsgebiet an Honigbienenstandorten geringer als an Kontrollstandorten. In homogenen Landschaften wurden die Hummelgemeinschaften dagegen von einer Art mit großem Sammelaktionsgebiet dominiert, unabhängig davon, ob Honigbienen hinzugefügt worden waren oder nicht. Wir schließen, dass Honigbienen Hummeldichten beeinflussen können, dass aber dieser Effekt durch die Heterogenität der Landschaft modifiziert wird.","['Flower resources', 'Interspecific competition', 'Landscape complexity', 'Pollinators']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

After the flowering of oilseed rape (OSR), simplified landscapes contained substantially less herbaceous flower resources and a lower proportion of perennials, compared to complex ones. The seasonal pattern of bumblebee abundance differed between landscape types. Initial bumblebee abundances were equal in both landscape types. However, by late July there was a sharp decline of bumblebees in simple landscapes, while the abundance continued to increase in complex landscapes. This suggests that a larger proportion of bumblebee colonies may fail to reproduce in simple landscapes despite a beneficial early season. Overall, bumblebee abundance in late July was positively related to three inter-related variables: area of permanent pasture, area of ley fields and total amount of herbaceous flowers, while early abundances (June to early July) did not relate to these variables. We suggest that in simplified landscapes of this region, bumblebee abundance is limited by floral resources mainly from midsummer and onward. Spring and early summer resources may indeed be sufficient for colony establishment and initial growth even in simplified landscapes, possibly as a result of large scale farming of OSR. The initially equal abundances of workers in simple and complex landscapes, as well as the fact that also many of the regionally rare species seem to persist in simple landscapes, suggest that rare species can survive in pockets of beneficial habitat and/or there may be an inflow of queens from nearby complex landscapes. If the latter is true, further simplification or abandonment of complex landscapes may threaten bumblebee populations also in neighbouring simple landscapes.","['Agriculture', 'Floral resources', 'Landscape structure', 'Mass flowering crop', 'Oilseed rape', 'Pollinator']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

One potential method of mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees. Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes, and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland.","['Agro-ecosystem', 'Attraction effect', 'Distance decay', 'Habitat quality', 'Landscape heterogeneity']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

Hence, effective information regarding runoff responses to future land use scenarios provides useful support for decision-making in land use planning and management. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology to assess land use change scenario impacts on runoff at the watershed scale. This objective implies translating qualitative information from scenarios into quantitative input parameters for biophysical models. To do so, qualitative information from scenarios should be quantified and spatialized. The approach is based on the combination of 2015 local land use change scenarios (SYSPHAMM method) based on local stakeholders expertise, a model of spatio-temporal allocation of crops to fields (LandSFACTS model) and a watershed runoff model (STREAM model). The study was conducted for regions underlain by silty loamy soils scattered across Northern Europe. It was applied on the Saussay watershed in Upper Normandy (France). The approach is illustrated through runoff assessment of one of the land use change scenarios (characterized by the ending of the set-aside obligation and the disappearance of dairy farming). This scenario appeared relevant for local stakeholders. The methodology presented suggests that assessing local land use scenarios in terms of runoff requires taking into account crop allocation diversity allowed by farmers' decision rules. This requirement accounts for runoff variability at the watershed outlet since crops spatial distribution throughout the watershed, depending on farmers' specific decision rules (i.e. cropping systems), strongly condition runoff phenomenon. Besides, choices regarding scenario implementation (quantification and spatialization) should to be made according to those cropping systems. Accordingly, taking into account crop allocation diversity due to farmers' cropping systems shows that there is a variability in terms of runoff at the watershed outlet (from 19 478m3 to 35 004m3 for the winter period and a low-intensity rainfall event for example). This variability can then be explored with local decision makers with the aim of finding solutions reducing runoff risks. The proposed approach provides a useful source of information for assessing the responses of surface runoff of future land use changes. Such scenarios providing impact assessment on runoff should encourage both local policy makers and local actors to actively discuss the future of land use in Upper Normandy.","['Crop allocation', 'Land use change', 'Runoff', 'STREAM model', 'Scenario']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Henning

For a number of commercially important species difficulties in rooting, overwintering and subsequent establishment of cuttings lead to inconsistent production. Why some species remain difficult to produce from cuttings, even when a highly supportive propagation environment is used, requires investigation. Experiments with a range of ornamental shrub species indicated that stockplant pruning could strongly influence cutting performance. Harder pruning significantly increased percentage rooting in Syringa and enhanced winter survival of Corylopsis, but decreased rooting and survival in Acer. In Syringa, rooting was closely related to shoot growth, and the retention of an active shoot tip on the cutting was important. Results suggested that shoot growth on the excised cutting was a better indicator of rooting potential than shoot growth on the hedge before cutting collection. In addition to influencing subsequent shoot vigour, bud position on the mother plant could affect rooting (Syringa) or winter survival (Rhododendron) directly. For certain species, factors associated with the early stages of propagation appeared to determine final establishment rates, even though initial rooting percentages were unaffected.

As a data base I used the single farm data of the farm censuses 1990, 1995 and 1999, partly complemented by the INVEKOS data pool and other data sources such as regional unemployment and income statistics. For the estimation I used a multivariate logistic regression model. First, it was possible to show that the probability of giving up farming declined particularly with participation in the Austrian environmental program OPUL, the total farm income and the size of direct payments (OPUL and program for mountain farmers). Furthermore, small and medium forest areas seem to improve the chance for farm survival, whereas farms with large forest areas are given up more frequently. In addition to economic factors, family conditions and personal properties of farm holders play an important role. For example, farm holders without children have a lower probability of surviving than farm holders with children, female farm holders give up more easily than male ones, and elder farm holders, as expected, more easily than young ones. Finally, I tested several regional factors, showing that the proximity to cities was particularly influential in increasing the chance of remaining in the sector.

They are particularly important for regression-based crop monitoring systems that rely on historic information. The major challenge lies in identifying pixels from satellite imagery that represent pure enough crop signals. Here, we present a data-driven semi-automatic approach to identify pure pixels of two crop groups (i.e., winter and spring crops and summer crops) based on a MODIS–NDVI timeseries. We applied this method to the European Union at a 250 m spatial resolution. Pre-processed and smoothed, daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data (2001–2017) were used to first extract the phenological data. To account for regional characteristics (varying climate, agro-management, etc.), these data were clustered by administrative units and by year using a Gaussian mixture model. The number of clusters was pre-defined using data from regional agricultural acreage statistics. After automatic labelling, clusters were filtered based on agronomic knowledge and phenological information extracted from the same timeseries. The resulting pure pixels were validated with two different datasets, one based on high-resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 sites, 2 years) and one based on a regional crop map (1 site, 7 years). For the winter and spring crop class, pixel purity amounted to 93% using the first validation dataset and to 73% using the second one, averaged over the different years. For summer crops, the respective values were 61% (91% without one critical validation site) and 72%. The phenological analyses revealed a clear trend towards an earlier NDVI peak (approximately −0.28 days/year) for winter and spring crops across Europe. We expect that this dataset will be useful for various applications, from crop model calibration to operational crop monitoring and yield forecasting.","['Agricultural production', 'Agriculture', 'Automation', 'Calibration', 'Clusters', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Crop yield', 'Crops', 'Data sets', 'Datasets', 'Environmental policy', 'Europe', 'Food security', 'Gaussian mixture model', 'Identification systems', 'Labelling', 'Machine learning', 'Maps', 'Monitoring', 'Physics', 'Pixels', 'Probabilistic models', 'Remote sensing', 'Satellite imagery', 'Satellites', 'Sensors', 'Spatial discrimination', 'Spatial resolution', 'Spring (season)', 'Summer', 'United States--US', 'Vegetation index', 'Winter', 'crop classification', 'crop monitoring', 'phenology', 'pixel purity', 'remote sensing', 'timeseries']",yes,yes,other,yes,yes,country,Henning

Managing field margins in a way that preserves, and preferably enhances, their value for biodiversity is therefore important. In the present study, we evaluate how the flora of uncultivated field margins is affected by the removal of woody vegetation as prescribed by an agri-environment scheme (AES) under the Swedish Rural Development Program 2007–2013. We used generalized linear mixed models and detrended correspondence analysis to compare the flora of open (cleared) and more overgrown field margins, located within agricultural landscapes of different complexity, in Scania, S.

However, the local (1m2) and transect (100m) level richness of non-woody species did not differ significantly between management categories, and there were no differences in the within-transect variability of non-woody species (local β diversity) or the species composition (0.25m2 plots) in managed and unmanaged field margins. Our results show that the removal of woody vegetation from uncultivated field margins, as prescribed by the evaluated AES, is unlikely to benefit non-woody plant species. The species composition of the sampled field margins suggests that inclusion of appropriate field layer management alone is unlikely to be sufficient to improve habitat conditions for grassland species unless measures are taken to counteract eutrophication. Landscape type, on the other hand, influenced both the total richness and the richness of each of the species groups that were considered to be of particular conservation value in the present study: field margins in the complex agricultural landscapes were significantly richer than those in the simple ones. Maintaining non-crop habitat at the landscape scale is likely to be a necessary first step in the prevention of a further decline of farmland plants.","['Agri-environment scheme', 'Landscape complexity', 'Local management', 'Uncultivated field margins', 'Woody vegetation']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

Flying insects were also caught in fields of lavandin, although emergence traps and plant uprooting did not confirm this crop as a winter host, i.e., as a reservoir for the insect. Based on one zone, we showed that attractiveness may depend on crop (clary sage or lavandin) and on its age, as well as on the distance to the supposed source field.

The identified constraints have been applied to specify current and regionally typical crop sequences as input data for large-scale ex ante assessments, here exemplary for the genome dispersal risk in the case of GM oilseed rape cultivation. The regional and spatio-temporal variation of crop sequences for oilseed rape was analysed and generalised through a combination of analytical, classification and up-scaling techniques. In order to anticipate and assess the dispersal risks of transgenic oilseed rape, the methodology was tuned on crop sequences, which strongly influence the temporal dispersal of genetically modified oilseed rape. The regional cropping patterns for oilseed rape were analysed for the four northernmost German federal states: Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Brandenburg. For typical regional crop clusters, specific crop sequences were derived, taking into account the constraints between crops and the weights for the particular crops as related to farm type. Real land-use data obtained at particular research sites were used to precisely determine the frequency of the single crops, as well as to discover sub-dominant crop combinations, which may have a high impact on dispersal processes. The introduced methodology stresses the following aspects: (i) reflection of the current situation due to links to periodically updated statistical data, (ii) implementation of the relationships and constraints between the different crops through statistical analyses, (iii) transfer of extensive, spatially limited agricultural data and expert knowledge to a large-scale context and (iv) integration of sub-dominant measures that are highly sensitive for particular processes.","['Classification', 'Crop rotations', 'Crop sequences', 'Cropping patterns', 'Methodology', 'Multivariate statistics', 'Oilseed rape', 'Up-scaling']",no,no,DE,yes,yes,data,Henning

This has disrupted the ability of soil to provide vital ecosystem services. Organic farming is often thought to conserve and utilise soil ecosystem services, and thus be a more sustainable method of food production than conventional farming. However, evidence for this is equivocal, and little is known of the potential trade-offs between soil functions, which can be classified as supporting and provisioning ecosystem services, in conventional and organic systems. In addition, few studies have simultaneously examined how surrounding landscape heterogeneity affects soil functions in agriculture. In this study we investigated the effects of farming method (conventional versus organic) and landscape heterogeneity (100m, 500m and 1000m radius) on indicators of soil ecosystem services: soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water holding capacity (WHC) and plant-available phosphorous (P) (measures of carbon storage and nutrient retention); net N mineralisation and microbial community composition and biomass (nutrient cycling); and crop yield. We found no effect of landscape heterogeneity, and no differences in any of the measured soil and microbial variables between conventional and organic farms, apart from net N mineralisation, which was higher in organic farms. However, conventional farms had significantly greater yield than organic farms, and there was no apparent trade-off between increasing yield and the level of supporting ecosystem services. The organic farms in this study appear to have been intensively managed, with a straight substitution of organic inputs for chemicals, but little other effort to enhance soil fertility. For example, the organic farms applied large quantities of manure compared with conventional farms but conducted mechanical weeding (harrowing), whereas conventional farms applied herbicides. This repeated soil disturbance may cause rapid organic matter mineralisation and undermine the ability of these organic farms to retain carbon and nitrogen. The terms ‘organic’ and ‘conventional’ agriculture both cover a wide variety of farming methods, some of which enhance or deplete ecosystem services more than others. To develop truly sustainable methods of agriculture, research should focus on the effects of specific farming practices, rather than the labels ‘conventional’ and ‘organic’.","['Agriculture', 'Carbon', 'Ecosystem services', 'Landscape complexity', 'Mycorrhizae', 'Soil microbial community']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

Information on which traits make species vulnerable and why may aid conservation of declining species. We performed a comprehensive analysis of how multiple traits related to diet breadth, movement and nesting habits moderate vulnerability of bumble bees to landscape simplification. We surveyed bumble bees in flower-rich non-crop habitats in either complex landscapes (with small crop fields bordered by non-crop habitats), or simple landscapes (with larger fields and therefore less non-crop habitats). We analysed if landscape type interacted with colony size, queen emergence date, colony life-cycle length, nesting habitat, thorax width, proboscis length or variability in thorax and proboscis, to explain bumble bee abundances. Workers and males of species with above-ground nests, small sized colonies and long colony cycle were relatively less abundant in simple compared to in complex landscapes. Simple landscapes hosted fewer males of late emerging species and species with highly variable proboscis length. This suggests that both nesting habitat and spatio-temporal availability of food resources act as ecological filters for bumble bees. Colony size correlated with nesting habitat and queen emergence when correcting for phylogenetic correlations, suggesting that landscape simplification acts through effects on combinations of traits. Our results have consequences for conservation by suggesting that declining bumble bee species can be supported by providing adequate nesting habitats and preferred plant species throughout the season and within short distance from nesting habitats, to allow utilisation also by species having colonies with few workers.","['Animal populations', 'Bees', 'Biology', 'Bombus', 'Habitats', 'Intra-specific variation', 'Life cycles', 'Life-history traits', 'Nesting habitat', 'Phenology', 'Phylogenetics', 'Phylogeny']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Henning

At the request of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES), our objective was to estimate which pesticides were probably used by each agricultural worker, in order to include this information in our analyses and search for association with diseases. We selected five databases to achieve this objective: the Graphical Land Parcel Registration (RPG), the French Agricultural Census, ""Cultivation Practice"" surveys from the Agriculture ministry, the MATPHYTO crop-exposure matrix and the Compilation of Phytosanitary Indexes from the French Public Health Agency. A geographical grid was designed to use geographical location while maintaining worker anonymity, dividing France into square tracts of variable surface each containing a minimum of 1500 agricultural workers. We developed an automated algorithm to predict each individual potential exposure by crossing her/his occupational activity, the geographical grid and the RPG to deduce cultivation practices and use it as a gateway to estimate pesticides use. This approach allowed drawing, from administrative data, a list of substances potentially used by each agricultural worker throughout France. Results of the algorithm are illustrated at collective level (descriptive statistics for the whole population), as well as at individual level (some workers taken as examples). The generalization of this method in other national contexts is discussed. By linking this information with the health insurance databases, this approach could contribute to the agricultural workers health surveillance.

For this focus, Member States (MS) are expected to establish Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), including a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) as the spatial part of IACS. Different MS have chosen different solutions for their LPIS. Currently, some MS based their IACS/LPIS on data from their Land Administration Systems (LAS), and many others use purpose built special systems for their IACS/LPIS. The issue with these different IACS/LPIS is that they do not have standardized structures; rather, each represents a unique design in each MS, both in the case of LAS based or special systems. In this study, we aim at designing a core data model for those IACS/LPIS based on LAS. For this purpose, we make use of the ongoing standardization initiatives for LAS (Land Administration Domain Model: LADM) and IACS/LPIS (LPIS Core Model: LCM).

Four common insect species, two omnivores and two herbivores, were monitored over 8 years in 10 willow short‐rotation coppice bio‐energy stands with a four‐year disturbance regime (coppice cycle). The population densities in these regularly disturbed stands were compared to densities in 17 undisturbed natural Salix cinerea (grey willow) stands in the same region. A time series approach was used, utilizing the natural variation between years to statistically model recolonization as a function of landscape composition under two different levels of regional density. Landscape composition, i.e. relative amount of forest vs. open agricultural habitats, largely determined the density of re‐colonizing populations following willow coppicing in three of the four species. However, the impact of landscape composition was not detectable in years with low regional density.

The organic farms economic profit was as well assessed in relation to their field of activity. Based on the analysis made, the economic situation is more favourable for the organically farming enterprises. Their economic results are actively influenced by subsidies without which an absolute majority of enterprises would be operating at a loss. (When including subsidies in the yields, 84.9% farms of the sample were profitable. On the other hand, while excluding subsidies, 95.7% of the enterprises were loss-making.)

Some of these farmland bird species breed to a varying degree also in non-farmland habitats; however, the indicator is calculated using trends estimated from all birds counted of each species, irrespective of habitat. Consequently, when interpreting indicators of farmland birds, it is important to know the influence of including the trends of the populations in non-farmland habitats. We estimated national and regional bird–habitat relationships and population trends of 14 of the species included in the Swedish version of FBI. Bird data came from the Swedish Bird Survey (1996–2008) including 716 separate routes, and detailed habitat data came from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (1999–2008). The proportion of individuals that occurred in non-farmland habitats ranged from 2% to 96%. Local densities were generally highest in farmland habitats, but because only 7–8% of the surface of Sweden is farmland, even low local densities in non-farmland sum up to high national totals. With few exceptions, the temporal trends of species were independent of the amount of farmland on routes, suggesting similar trends within and outside farmland. Accordingly, incorporating data on farmland birds from non-farmland habitats had only a limited effect on the FBI. But given that habitat-specific trends may well occur, it is important that multi-species indices are checked for potential habitat-specific differences among the included species.","['Farmland Bird Index', 'Farmland birds', 'Habitat-specific trends', 'Multispecies indicator', 'Population trends', 'Species–habitat relationship']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Max

The primary objective of this study was to analyse historical long-term changes of wetlands in the lowland areas of the Czech Republic, with emphasis on their spatio-temporal changes in the landscape and with stress on the use of different types of information sources. The following research questions were asked: (1) What are the wetland spatio-temporal changes (expressed through the number and size of continuously existing, extinct, and recent wetlands) and wetland change trajectories (expressed by quantifying and localising LULC categories that replaced extinct wetlands as well as categories of LULC at the expense of which wetlands occur) in the lowland landscape of the Czech Republic? (2) What methodological conclusions and recommendations for the investigation of wetland changes in a landscape can be derived from the study? The sources used for the study included historical maps from the Stable Land Registry 1841, a current orthophoto map (2015), the DIBAVOD database, LPIS [Land-Parcel Identification System] database verification, the Czech Land Registry, and field mapping (2015). Three wetland biotope types were examined: swamps and marshes, waterlogged meadows, and waterlogged woody vegetation. Spatial analysis using GIS tools (intersection, symmetrical difference) was performed to analyse the spatio-temporal wetland changes. The total wetland area has decreased dramatically from 5762ha (over 9.5% of the territory included in the study) in 1825–1843 to 54ha (0.9%) in 2014. Extinct wetlands predominate (99.1%) in the area, whilst recent and continuous wetlands are nearly identical (0.5% and 0.4%, respectively). A selected sample of 10 cadastral districts was used to examine the error against the DIBAVOD method and find that the error is relatively low (0.13%). The results of this study document fundamental spatio-temporal changes (expressed through change trajectories) of wetland biotopes at the landscape level in the lowland and hilly areas of the Czech Republic. The most frequent change type is wetland loss in favour of arable land (nearly one-half of all wetlands) due to extensive agricultural management. The use of the DIBAVOD method is effective, taking the relatively low error into account. The results of the study substantially contribute to the development of methods for the investigation of spatio-temporal changes in wetlands and other selected biotopes in the context of the landscape.","['Change trajectories', 'Habitat continuity', 'Land use/cover history', 'Wetlands']",yes,yes,CZ,yes,no,,Max

By providing pollinating insects with pollen and nectar, oilseed rape benefits short-tongued, generalist insect species. Long-tongued bumble bee species, specialized to other flower types, may instead be negatively affected by increased competition from the generalists (e.g. due to nectar-robbing of long-tubed flowers) after oilseed rape flowering has ceased. We expected that the increased abundance of short-tongued pollinators and reduced abundance of long-tongued bumble bees in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape would impact the pollination of later flowering wild plant species. In addition, we expected contrasting effects on plants pollinated by short-tongued pollinators and those pollinated by long-tongued bumble bees. We predicted that semi-natural grasslands, which provide insects with alternative floral resources, would reduce both negative and positive effects on pollination by mitigating competition between pollinators. In 16 semi-natural grasslands, surrounded by agricultural landscapes, with a variation in both the proportion of oilseed rape and the proportion of semi-natural grassland within 1km, we studied reproductive output in two species of potted plants with different pollination strategies: the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). The first species is mainly pollinated by short-tongued pollinators, e.g. hoverflies and solitary bees, and the latter by long-tongued bumble bees. Both species flowered after oilseed rape. Strawberry weight was higher in landscapes with a high proportion of oilseed rape, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of semi-natural grassland. The proportion of developed achenes was also positively related to the proportion of oilseed rape, but only during the latest flowering period. In contrast, red clover seed set was unrelated to the proportion of oilseed rape. Whereas the discrepancy between the two strawberry measurements calls for further research, this study suggests that oilseed rape can affect later flowering plants and that the impact differs among species.","['Canola', 'Rapeseed', 'Tongue-length']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Max

In many ways, result-oriented agri-environmental schemes can be expected to prove superior to the measure-oriented schemes which are currently most widely used. It is demonstrated how a checklist of indicator species can be derived by using expert knowledge and statistical crosschecks with a database of pre-existing vegetation samples. These species are indicators for conservationally relevant, agriculturally usable grassland on moderately dry to moderately wet sites. The qualities that make a site eligible for remuneration are defined by societal demand as expressed through political objectives and guidelines. One of the challenges in deriving an indicator checklist was to represent quality through species that not only satisfy scientific criteria like validity, but are also operational within remuneration programmes. For example, operational indicator species have to be easily identifiable.

Proper management techniques are indispensable for sustainable soil protection to ensure its function in the long term. A number of concepts exist to develop risk maps on the basis of soil inherent susceptibility to compaction at a given soil moisture level (mostly field capacity). However, the real soil conditions, e.g., current soil moisture content at the time of field work and the real machinery load, are not taken into account. To bridge this gap, we present a multi-data approach for qualitative risk assessment, which combines spatially and temporally explicit data on soil, soil moisture, and land use information. The contributing components integrate daily probability distribution, including inter- and intra-annual variations in land use and weather. We combined soil susceptibility to compaction and field work for the federal state of Lower Saxony per half-months and identified three clusters with more or less compaction risk for Lower Saxony. In spring, mainly manure spreading to maize and in autumn harvesting of maize and sugar beets are contributing to the yearly probability of compaction risk in top soils. With the presented approach risk areas can be identified. For the evaluation of the current compaction risks, farm specifications on machinery and timing of field work must also be taken into account.","['Agricultural equipment', 'Animal wastes', 'Annual variations', 'Arable land', 'Corn', 'Environmental Studies', 'Field capacity', 'Gene mapping', 'Harvesting', 'Human influences', 'Information processing', 'Land use', 'Land use management', 'Machinery', 'Machinery and equipment', 'Moisture content', 'Probability distribution', 'Qualitative analysis', 'Risk assessment', 'Soil compaction', 'Soil conditions', 'Soil moisture', 'Spatial data', 'Sugar beets', 'Topsoil', 'Water content', 'risk assessment', 'soil compaction', 'soil functions', 'soil management']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Max

We show that climate changes lead to increased irrigation water demands in the future, which will not always be able to be met. The resulting water deficits were shown for different crops depending on their irrigation priority and the water available. With an increased irrigation area, water deficits will rise. This may limit the profitability of agricultural irrigation. The impacts of climate change on low-flow conditions in the river are much higher than those of the increase in irrigated area alone.

This is a complex task, particularly when terraces are associated to complex vegetation cover patterns, as happens with permanent crops (e.g. olive trees). In this study we present a novel methodology for automatic and cost-efficient identification of terraces using only imagery from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) cameras on board unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, we generated orthoimagery and digital surface models (DSMs) at 11 cm spatial resolution with low user intervention. In a second stage, these data were used to identify terraces using a multi-scale object-oriented classification method. Results show the potential of this method even in highly complex agricultural areas, both regarding DSM reconstruction and image classification. The UAV-derived DSM had a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than 0.5 m when the height of the terraces was assessed against field GPS data. The subsequent automated terrace classification yielded an overall accuracy of 90% based exclusively on spectral and elevation data derived from the UAV imagery.","['Agricultural terraces', 'Common agricultural policy', 'Digital surface model', 'Object-oriented analysis', 'Unmanned aerial vehicles', 'Very high resolution imagery']",yes,yes,ES,Yes,yes,wrong country,Max

However, to meet the animals' nutritional requirements, today's rations for high yielding dairy cows also contain substantial amounts of potentially human-edible feeds (e.g. cereals and pulses), which increases competition between animal feed and human food availability. The aim of the present study was therefore to calculate the human-edible feed conversion efficiency (heFCE) for 30 Austrian dairy farms operating under different production systems in order to evaluate their contribution to net food production. The heFCE was calculated at farm gate level on a gross energy and crude protein basis, and was defined as potentially human-edible output in the form of animal products (milk and meat) divided by the input of potentially human-edible feedstuffs. The potentially human-edible fraction of all feedstuffs used on the 30 farms was estimated based on available literature using a “low,” “medium,” and “high” scenario, representing low, average, and above average extraction rates of human-edible nutrients from feedstuffs, respectively. The human-edible fraction ranged from 0% for some fibrous feedstuffs up to 100% for some cereals in the high scenario. For the “medium” scenario, heFCE ranged from 0.50 up to 2.95 for energy and from 0.47 up to 2.15 for protein. About half of the analysed farms showed a heFCE below 1, indicating a net loss in food supply. For both energy and protein, heFCE was negatively correlated with the amount of concentrates per kg milk and the total amount of concentrates per cow and year. In addition, we found a positive correlation between heFCE and the area of grassland utilized per ton of milk, as well as a negative correlation between heFCE and the area of arable land required per ton of milk. Therefore, feeding large amounts of concentrates to dairy cows has to be questioned in terms of the heFCE. The results of this study clearly show that grass-based dairy production highly contributes to net food production, particularly if the amount of concentrates per kg milk is reduced.","['Dairy production', 'Feed versus food competition', 'Food security', 'Grass-based', 'Human-edible feed conversion efficiency', 'Ruminant']",yes,yes,AT,Yes,no,,Max

Furthermore, to assess the crop-specific management in a spatio-temporal context accurately, parcel-related crop rotation information is additionally needed. Such data is scarcely available for a regional scale, so that only modeled crop rotations can be incorporated instead. However, the spectrum of the occurring multiannual land use patterns on arable land remains unknown. Thus, this contribution focuses on the mapping of the actually practiced crop rotations in the Rur catchment, located in the western part of Germany. We addressed this by combining multitemporal multispectral remote sensing data, ancillary information and expert-knowledge on crop phenology in a GIS-based Multi-Data Approach (MDA). At first, a methodology for the enhanced differentiation of the major crop types on an annual basis was developed. Key aspects are (i) the usage of physical block data to separate arable land from other land use types, (ii) the classification of remote sensing scenes of specific time periods, which are most favorable for the differentiation of certain crop types, and (iii) the combination of the multitemporal classification results in a sequential analysis strategy. Annual crop maps of eight consecutive years (2008–2015) were combined to a crop sequence dataset to have a profound data basis for the mapping of crop rotations. In most years, the remote sensing data basis was highly fragmented. Nevertheless, our method enabled satisfying crop mapping results. As an example for the annual crop mapping workflow, the procedure and the result of 2015 are illustrated. For the generation of the crop sequence dataset, the eight annual crop maps were geometrically smoothened and integrated into a single vector data layer. The resulting dataset informs about the occurring crop sequence for individual areas on arable land, so that crop rotation schemes can be derived. The resulting dataset reveals that the spectrum of the practiced crop rotations is extremely heterogeneous and contains a large amount of crop sequences, which strongly diverge from model crop rotations. Consequently, the integration of remote sensing-based crop rotation data can considerably reduce uncertainties regarding the management in regional agro-ecosystem modeling. Finally, the developed methods and the results are discussed in detail.","['Ancillary data', 'Crop classification', 'Crop rotation', 'GIS', 'Phenology', 'Regional agro-ecosystem modeling']",yes,no,DE,Yes,no,,Max

To address this gap, we use plot-level data from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) for Germany's federal state of Brandenburg, and based on a two-step cluster analysis, we identify six types of agricultural landscapes. These clusters differ in landscape structure, diversity and measures for agricultural land management intensity. Agricultural land in Brandenburg is dominated by high shares of cropland but fragmented differently. Lands under organic management and those with a high share of maize show strong spatial autocorrelation, pointing to local clusters. Identification of different types of landscapes permits locally- and region-adapted designs of environmental and agricultural policy measures improves outcome-oriented environmental policy impact evaluation and landscape planning.

The differences between the two plot groups and between sampling seasons were not statistically significant because of the large variance.In the autumn samples, seven species were identified among the retrieved seedlings, and two further species were registered in the small un-germinated fraction. The spring samples included only four identified species within the germinable fraction; no further species were determined among many dormant seeds. The alpha-diversity studies revealed some salient features: (1) the soil seed reserve included mostly immigrant species, and only few species used in the restoration were represented; (2) compared to the standing vegetation, much fewer species occurred in the soil samples: (3) the relative frequency of species in the seed reserve did not correspond to the species frequency in the plant cover of the plots.Considered both in the terms of diaspore accumulation and increase of alpha-diversity, the soil seed reserve developed within only ca 10 years after restoration represents an important symptom of active plant population processes occurring in the restoration plots.

An important aspect affecting the accuracy of change detection is finding the optimal indicators of LULC changes (i.e., variables). Inappropriately selected variables can produce inaccurate results burdened with a number of uncertainties. The aim of our study is to find the most suitable variables for the detection of grassland to cropland change, based on a pair of high resolution images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite and from the vector database Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). In total, 59 variables were used to create models using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), the quality of which was verified through multi-temporal object-based change detection. Satisfactory accuracy for the detection of grassland to cropland change was achieved using all of the statistically identified models. However, a three-variable model can be recommended for practical use, namely by combining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wetness and Fifth components of Tasselled Cap. Increasing number of variables did not significantly improve the accuracy of detection, but rather complicated the interpretation of the results and was less accurate than detection based on the original Landsat 8 images. The results obtained using these three variables are applicable in landscape management, agriculture, subsidy policy, or in updating existing LULC databases.

Three climate scenarios with identical temperature trends but diverging precipitation patterns shall represent uncertainty ranges from climate change, i.e. a dry and wet situation. Water protection policies are clustered to two policy portfolios WAP_I and WAP_II, which are targeted to regions (WAP_I) or applied at the national scale (WAP_II). Policies cover agri-environmental programs and legal standards and tackle management measures such as restrictions in fertilizer, soil and crop rotation management as well as establishment of buffer strips. Results show that average national agricultural gross margin varies by ±2%, but regional impacts are more pronounced particularly under a climate scenario with decreasing precipitation sums. WAP_I can alleviate pressures compared to the business as usual scenario but does not lead to the achievement of environmental quality standards for P in all rivers. WAP_II further reduces total nutrient emissions but at higher total private land use costs. At the national average, total private land use costs for reducing nutrient emission loads in surface waters are 60–200 €/kg total N and 120–250 €/kg total P with precipitation and the degree of regional targeting as drivers. To conclude, the IIMF is able to capture the interfaces between climate change, land use, and water quality in a policy context. Despite efforts to improve model linkages and the robustness of model output, uncertainty propagations in integrated modelling frameworks need to be tackled in subsequent studies.","['Adaptation', 'Agriculture', 'Climate change', 'Impact modelling', 'Scenarios', 'Socio-economic drivers', 'Water protection policy']",yes,yes,AT,yes,no,,Max

As an advance to current static assessments, we present a dynamic soil functions assessment (SFA) to evaluate the current and future state of soils regarding their nutrient storage, water regulation, productivity, habitat and carbon sequestration functions for the case-study region in the Lower Austrian Mostviertel. Carbon response functions simulating the development of regional soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks until 2100 are used to couple established indicator-based SFA methodology with two climate and three land use scenarios, i.e. land sparing (LSP), land sharing (LSH), and balanced land use (LBA). Results reveal a dominant impact of land use scenarios on soil functions compared to the impact from climate scenarios and highlight the close link between SOC development and the quality of investigated soil functions, i.e. soil functionality. The soil habitat and soil carbon sequestration functions on investigated agricultural land are positively affected by maintenance of grassland under LSH (20% of the case-study region), where SOC stocks show a steady and continuous increase. By 2100 however, total regional SOC stocks are higher under LSP compared to LSH or LBA, due to extensive afforestation. The presented approach may improve integrative decision-making in land use planning processes. It bridges superordinate goals of sustainable development, such as climate change mitigation, with land use actions taken at local or regional scales. The dynamic SFA broadens the debate on LSH and LSP and can reduce trade-offs between soil functions through land use planning processes.","['Austria', 'Climate change', 'Dynamic soil functions assessment', 'Land use scenario', 'Regional case-study', 'Soil organic carbon']",yes,yes,AT,yes,no,,Max

Such assessment is, however, hampered by the complex nature of the soil threats, which result from the sometimes poorly understood interaction of various soil physical properties, climatic factors and land management practices. Methodologies for risk assessment of soil threats are needed to protect the soil quality for future generations and to target resources to the areas at greatest risk. We present here a generic risk framework for the development of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to estimate the risk from soil threats. The generic BBN structure follows a standard risk assessment approach, where the risk is quantified by combining assessments of vulnerability and exposure. The soil's vulnerability to a given threat is determined from inherent soil and site characteristics as well as from climatic factors influencing soil characteristics, while the exposure estimate is based on an evaluation of the stresses inflicted by land management and climate. The generic framework is demonstrated by taking soil compaction as an example. Soil compaction is a major threat to soil function particularly in highly managed agricultural systems and is known to have many adverse effects on farming systems including decreased crop yield and soil productivity, increased management costs, increased emissions of greenhouse gases, and decreased water infiltration into the soil leading to accelerated run-off and risk of soil erosion. Existing modelling approaches to predict soil compaction risk either require data on soil mechanical behaviour that are difficult and expensive to collect, or are expert-based systems that are highly subjective and sometimes cannot accommodate the myriad of processes underlying compaction risk. Using the generic framework, a detailed BBN for assessing the risk of soil compaction is developed. The BBN allows for combining available data from standard soil surveys and land use databases with qualitative expert knowledge and explicitly accounts for uncertainties in the assessment of the risk. The BBN is applied to identify the distribution of the compaction risk across Scotland using data from the National Soils Inventory of Scotland.","['Bayesian Belief Network', 'Expert knowledge', 'Risk assessment', 'Soil Framework directive', 'Soil compaction', 'Uncertainty']",?,?,?,yes,yes,wrong country,Max

A systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi-seasonal dry spells, effective adaptation measures, and the economic value of climate information (VoI) may inform decision-making and facilitate the uptake and use of climate information.

Results from the integrated modeling framework show that the average economic value of climate information ranges between 13 and 99 €/ha for Austrian cropland, depending on the scenario of multi-seasonal dry spells and the farmers’ risk aversion level. On average, the value of climate information is highest on flat and productive soils, for root and oil crops, under more extreme multi-seasonal dry spells, and if farmers are highly risk averse. Quantifying the value of climate information may guide data provision efforts and highlight agricultural production regions, which would particularly benefit from such information to improve water stress management.","['Climate change adaptation', 'Integrated modeling', 'Irrigation water use', 'Multi-seasonal dry spell and drought', 'Portfolio optimization', 'Value of information']",yes,no?,AT,yes,no,,Max

That is, it has been an open question whether agricultural intensity and landscape simplicity should be regarded as one single or as two separate dimensions. To evaluate this we analysed landscape data in 136 different 1km×1km study sites and within a buffer zone of 2km around each site (i.e. approximately 5km×5km). The sites were distributed over a large part of the region of Scania, southernmost Sweden, an area dominated by agriculture but with large variation in both intensity and complexity. We used spatially explicit digital data on land use, digitised aerial photographs, field surveys of landscape elements and agricultural statistics. Two separate factor analyses, one for each scale of measurements (1km and 5km), suggest that there are five and three relevant factors for each scale respectively. At the 1km scale, the first factor can be interpreted as describing the intensity of land use in the form of proportion arable land which is highly correlated to crop yield. The second and third factors are more connected to landscape structure and amount of small patches of semi-natural habitats. The fourth and fifth factors contain one major variable each: proportion pasture and leys respectively. The division of intensity and complexity related variables is less clear at a larger spatial scale. At the 5km scale, factor 1 is defined almost identically as at the 1km scale. However, factors 2 and 3 are interpreted as descriptors of dairy and livestock farming systems but also include structural variables. Our analyses suggest that land use intensity and structural complexity of landscapes are more or less separate landscape level factors, at least at smaller spatial scales.

To provide triangulation of the participatory with academic research results, C. autumnale was mapped in three municipalities, covering in total 686 ha. The majority of all grassland plots were extensively managed meadows. More than half of them were not fertilised and were subject to nature conservation regulations. Farmers reported an increase of C. autumnale on 44% of all grassland plots. Of these, grassland management has been extensified in 64%. About 27% of all farmers regarded C. autumnale as a problem. Among farmers who sold hay, 48% considered it as problematic. The field survey showed that C. autumnale covers up to 73% of grasslands.

Agro-ecosystems contribute a significant share of these services, besides food and fodder and also fuel and fibre as well as regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Until now, the indication of provisioning ecosystem services of agro-ecosystems has been based almost only on yield numbers of agricultural products. Such an indication is problematic due to several reasons which include a disregard of the role of significant anthropogenic contributions to ecosystem service co-generation, external environmental effects and strong dependence on site conditions. We argue for an enhanced indication of provisioning ecosystem services that considers multiple aspects of their delivery. The conceptual base for such an indication has been made by prior publications which have been reviewed. Relevant points were taken up in this article and condensed into a conceptual model in order to develop a more holistic and expanded set of indictors, which was then exemplarily applied and tested in three case studies in Germany. The case studies represent different natural conditions, and the indicator set application showed that ecosystem services (ES) flow—in terms of output alone—does not characterise agro-ecosystems sufficiently. The proposed aspects of provisioning ecosystem services can give a fuller picture, for example, by input-output relationships, as it is possible by just using single indicators. Uncertainties as well as pros and cons of such an approach are elaborated. Finally, recommendations for an enhanced indication of provisioning ecosystem services in agro-ecosystems that can help to integrate agricultural principles with ideas of sustainability and site-specific land use are derived.","['Agricultural ecosystems', 'Agricultural landscapes', 'Agricultural products', 'Anthropogenic factors', 'Case studies', 'Cogeneration', 'Crop yield', 'Ecosystem services', 'Ecosystems', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental effects', 'Fodder', 'Indication', 'Indicators', 'Land use', 'Management', 'Provisioning', 'Site-specific land use', 'Sustainability', 'Sustainable agriculture']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Max

In regions with persistent cloud coverage during the vegetation season this is only feasible with active systems, such as SAR, and is limited for optical data. To date, optical remote sensing vegetation indices are more frequently used to monitor agricultural vegetation status because they are easily processed, and the characteristics are widely known. This study evaluated the correlations of three Sentinel-2 optical indices with Sentinel-1 SAR indices over agricultural areas to gain knowledge about their relationship. We compared Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, and Plant Senescence Radiation Index with Sentinel-1 SAR VV and VH backscatter, VH/VV ratio, and Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index. The study was conducted on 22 test sites covering approximately 35,000 ha of four different main European agricultural land use types, namely grassland, maize, spring barley, and winter wheat, in Lower Saxony, Germany, in 2018. We investigated the relationship between Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 indices for each land use type considering three phenophases (growing, green, senescence). The strength of the correlations of optical and SAR indices differed among land use type and phenophase. There was no generic correlation between optical and SAR indices in our study. However, when the data were split by land use types and phenophases, the correlations increased remarkably. Overall, the highest correlations were found for the Radar Vegetation Index and VH backscatter. Correlations for grassland were lower than for the other land use types. Adding auxiliary data to a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that, in addition to land use type and phenophase information, the lower quartile and median SAR values per field, and a spatial variable, improved the models. Other auxiliary data retrieved from a digital elevation model, Sentinel-1 orbit direction, soil type information, and other SAR values had minor impacts on the model performance. In conclusion, despite the different nature of the signal generation, there were distinct relationships between optical and SAR indices which were independent of environmental variables but could be stratified by land use type and phenophase. These relationships showed similar patterns across different test sites.

We studied ground beetles in fields with different agricultural land use ranging from frequently managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to less intensively managed grasslands. The ground beetles were collected in emergence tents that catch individuals overwintering locally in different life stages and with pitfall traps that catch individuals that could have a local origin or may have dispersed into the field. Community weighted mean values for ground beetle traits such as body size, flight ability and feeding preference were estimated for each land-use type and sampling method. In fields with high land-use intensity the average body length of emerging ground beetle communities was lower than in the grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between the land-use types. The proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in the crop fields as compared to the grasslands.

We analyze the effects of scale on ES estimates and their spatial pattern and show how these effects are related to different ES, terrain structure and model properties. ES estimates differ substantially between the fine and coarse resolution analyses in all case studies and across all services. This scale effect is not equally strong for all ES. We show that spatially explicit information about non-clustered, isolated ES tends to be lost at coarse resolution and against expectation, mainly in less rugged terrain, which calls for finer resolution assessments in such contexts.

The advent of molecular approaches now makes it possible to get a precise picture of diet and its plasticity, even for endangered and elusive species. Here, we focused on the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in Western France, where this insectivorous species has been classified as “Vulnerable” on the Regional Red List in 2016. We applied an eDNA metabarcoding approach to 1986 fecal samples collected in six maternity colonies on three sampling dates. We described the diet and investigated whether the landscape surrounding colonies and the different phases of the maternity cycle influenced the diversity and the composition of this diet. We showed that R. ferrumequinum feed on a much more diverse prey spectrum than expected from previous studies, highlighting how eDNA metabarcoding can improve our knowledge on the dietary habits of elusive species. Our approach also revealed that the diet of R. ferrumequinum seems to be composed of two distinct features: the core diet consisting of a few preferred taxa shared by all the colonies (25% of the occurrences) and the secondary diet consisting of numerous rare prey taxa that were highly different between colonies and sampling dates (75% of the occurrences). Constraints associated with the greater horseshoe bat life cycle, as well as insect phenology and landscape features, strongly influenced the diversity and composition of both the core diet and the diet as a whole.

We tested the effects of three major independent variables – farmland fragmentation, urbanization economies and farm size structure with particular emphasis on the relationship between land-use fragmentation and microregional differences in agricultural labour productivity. Our principal question therefore was if higher agricultural labour productivity at microregional level is associated with internal scale economies resulting from large average farm size (in terms of employment), proximity to large cities as a proxy for urbanization economies and lower levels of land-use fragmentation. We also asked if productivity gains from large average size of plots is higher than potential losses resulting from land tenure (tenants are generally less productive than farmland owners). Drawing on a case study of Czechia – a country with extremely fragmented farmland ownership, but the largest average size of plots in the EU and a strong role of farmland rental market – we confirmed our initial expectation that land-use fragmentation affects negatively microregional agricultural labour productivity. Larger average size of plots is positively related to microregional agricultural labour productivity despite potentially negative effects of land tenure.

With almost no permanent vegetation in small headwater catchments, and with few physical obstacles to reduce runoff velocities, runoff concentration along linear landscape elements (plot boundaries) or thalwegs frequently causes ephemeral gullies to form — the latter reflecting the poor hydrogeomorphic condition of the land- and soilscape. To address this problem, and to remediate negative on- and off-site effects, land management efforts have multiplied over the past decades in many regions. This includes, amongst other measures, the implementation of vegetation barriers called ‘fascines’. In the loess-dominated Aa River basin of northern France, where cropland accounts for 67% of the cover, we investigated the effect of fascines on ephemeral gully erosion dynamics, together with rainfall characteristics and cropland management. This was accomplished through a spatially explicit study of 269 sites prone to ephemeral gullying using a diachronic analysis of historical aerial photographs. Between 1947 and 2012, ephemeral gully densities at the scale of the Aa River basin (643km2) varied between 0.39 and 1.31mha−1 (long-term average of 0.68mha−1 (with local maxima up to 9.35mha−1). Densities are, however, much higher when only considering the most erosion-vulnerable municipalities (long-term average of 2.23–4.30mha−1); those values should be used when comparing results from this study to other reports of ephemeral gully erosion. Fascines were introduced in 2001 and were present in ~30% of the gully erosion sites by 2012. Although the presence of fascines has an effect on gully length reduction, spatial and temporal variations in gully length were mainly driven by cumulative precipitation. Measurement of sediment deposition at 29 fascines in 2016 showed that only 47% of the fascines functioned as sediment sinks. They stored on average 1.7Mg of sediment per winter half-year, corresponding to 0.009Mgha−1. The results suggest that fascines positively impact the landscape's resilience and reduce ephemeral gully erosion rates. The use of vegetation barriers such as fascines are increasingly implemented for erosion control in western Europe, but pose problems for the management of open-field landscapes.","['Aa River valley', 'Aerial photograph', 'Ephemeral gully', 'Fascine']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Max

A total of more than 150,000 risk points were identified by GIS morphology and land-use analysis. The threat, the vulnerability, and the resulting risk category were determined for each of these points. The WaTEM/SEDEM model was used to assess the threat with 10-m data resolution. The summarized vulnerability of real objects on individual runoff trajectories was combined with the threat of sediment transport, resulting in the overall risk represented by a 5-degree scale, from lowest (1) to highest (5).

Therefore, resource variability can impact animals’ home range formation, especially in spatially and temporally highly dynamic landscapes, such as farmland.

We tested whether increasing resource variability forces herbivorous mammals to increase their home ranges.MethodsIn 2014 and 2015 we collared 40 European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) with GPS-tags to record hare movements in two regions in Germany with differing landscape structures. We examined hare home range sizes in relation to resource availability and variability by using the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy.ResultsHares in simple landscapes showed increasing home range sizes with increasing resource variability, whereas hares in complex landscapes did not enlarge their home range.ConclusionsAnimals in complex landscapes have the possibility to include various landscape elements within their home ranges and are more resilient against resource variability. But animals in simple landscapes with few elements experience shortcomings when resource variability becomes high. The increase in home range size, the movement related increase in energy expenditure, and a decrease in hare abundances can have severe implications for conservation of mammals in anthropogenic landscapes.

We present an up-scaling approach that was based on scenario assumptions concerning the percentage of GM cultivation and took into account natural and anthropogenic variation of involved dispersal processes. The applied methods include computer modelling and spatial analysis. A simulation model (GeneTraMP) was used to calculate the spatio-temporal pattern of the spread of a neutral transgene (without any specific function) in OSR. Basic scenario calculations were carried out for different spatial configurations covering 1km2 each and taking into account information on climate and cultivation systems of the region of the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. For the exemplary regional study presented here, we analysed the numbers of flowering plants of GM OSR in different types of locations as predicted by the model. The results confirmed the expectation of a very high variability of GM occurrences at distinguishable intensity levels which were closely related to the proximity of areas of intended GM oilseed rape cultivation and may be described by a combination of management parameters and location type. The up-scaling method included a spatial analysis of the target region. Based on satellite images and digital maps, the structure of the region was analysed resulting in a map of Schleswig-Holstein that represents each single field, also including information on crop rotation, ownership and production systems. Applying GIS queries to this database, we identified the area of relevant location types. Both, the model results and the spatial data were used to predict the total numbers of flowering GM OSR plants for the region of Schleswig-Holstein. As an important feature, the up-scaling of modelling results to a larger scale allows for a comprehensive analysis by also enclosing regional parameters, as, for example the cropping density. The presented methods can support decision making if they are incorporated into the planning of an environmental monitoring of commercial GM crops or into life cycle assessment and cost–benefit analyses of GMO cultivation.","['Co-existence', 'Environmental effects', 'GIS', 'Genetically modified organisms', 'Monitoring', 'Oilseed rape', 'Simulation model', 'Spatial analysis', 'Spread', 'Up-scaling']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Max

They are specially relevant for decision support in land planning and biological conservation. Matching connectivity analyses with practical actions in agricultural landscapes involves considering management units rather than habitat patches. However, at a local scale, the classical method for prioritizing graph elements (node removal) using connectivity indexes such as delta IIC could be viewed as a highly contrived approach with respect to the actual changes in land use. Here we address the relevance of this method compared to simulations likely to display these land-use changes in a more realistic way. Prioritization as determined by the removal method is tested here against simulated land-use changes in four scenarios (e.g. replacing grasslands by croplands) for an agricultural area in the Jura massif (eastern France) where field actions are undertaken to combat the spread of grassland rodents. The results obtained by ranking all the parcels (“enumerative” approach) show that the removal method provides rankings similar to those obtained with the land-use change scenarios, except for the planting of hedgerows. However, defining a limited number of key parcels (“cumulative” approach) results in different rankings whatever the scenarios. This shows that when applying parcel-based graphs to practical actions, the reliability of the removal method depends on the way the connectivity analysis is conducted. Simulating land-use changes, which is more realistic but more time-consuming, proves relevant if only a few key parcels need to be identified for actions to be conducted in the field.","['Agricultural parcel', 'Connectivity metric', 'Land-use change', 'Landscape connectivity', 'Prioritization']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Max

Whereas the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscapes has been shown to stabilize the species richness of flower visitors, the effect of farming intensity has not yet been studied. In this study, we compared the temporal and spatial stability (continuity of species richness in space and time) of two groups of flower-visiting insects (butterflies and bumblebees) between nine conventional and ten organic farms, distributed along a gradient of semi-natural grassland proportion. We surveyed bumblebees, butterflies and local flower cover during the growing season, covering multiple years and several habitat types per farm (cereal fields, temporary grasslands and semi-natural grasslands). At the field scale we found that within-year stability of bumblebee species richness was higher in organic than in conventional temporary grasslands (leys), because of a higher continuity of in-field flower resources. Further analyses showed that late-season flower resources in organic ley fields were critical to maintain a high within-year stability of bumblebee species richness by reducing resource bottlenecks during that period, when most bumblebee colonies produce new queens. The among-year stability of bumblebee species richness was higher in organic than in conventional cereal fields, whereas the within and among-year stability of butterfly species richness was not influenced by farming system. On the farm scale, we found that the spatial stability of butterfly and bumblebee species richness was higher in organic than in conventional farms, but this was not explained by a greater spatial continuity of flower resources. Our study shows that organic farming reduces the spatiotemporal fluctuations in bumblebee and butterfly species richness. In addition, increasing floral resources as such benefits bumblebees and butterflies irrespective of farming system. Organic farming and increasing availability in floral resources therefore contribute to maintaining the within and between-year stability of bumblebees and butterflies in agricultural landscapes.","['Biodiversity', 'Flower-visiting insects', 'Landscape management', 'Organic farming', 'Spatial stability', 'Temporal stability']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Max

We studied the impact of maize and rapeseed on the abundance of skylark (Alauda arvensis). Field-scale studies in Western Europe have reported diverse impacts on habitat selection and demography. We assessed the consistency between field-scale knowledge and landscape-scale observations, using high-resolution databases describing crops and other habitats for the 4 km2 grid scales analyzed in the French Breeding Bird Survey. We used generalized linear models to estimate the impact of each studied crop at the landscape scale. We stratified the squares according to the local and geographical contexts, to ensure that the conclusions drawn were valid in a wide range of contexts. Our results were not consistent with field knowledge for rapeseed, and were consistent for maize only in grassland contexts. However, the effect sizes were much smaller than those of structural landscape features.

This information can be obtained through the analysis of images obtained through optical satellite remote sensing. Activities such as accurate discrimination of crops require dense time-series of satellite data which can capture the diverse crop phenology. However, given the presence of clouds at important periods of crops’ development, the required time-series is impossible to obtain from just one optical satellite sensor. The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project by NASA provides fused data from both Operational Land Imager and Multispectral Instrument optical sensors of Landsat and Sentinel systems respectively. The present study used a multi-temporal HLS data and a target-oriented cross-validation (TOV) modelling approach with random forest algorithm to discriminate 13 crop types. 15 phenological metrics derived from time-series HLS data, together with 48 spectral and 2 topographic information were used as predictors in the model. A forward feature selection (FFS) procedure of the TOV was used to improve the classification model. 16 predictors comprising of spectral, phenological and topographic information were selected as useful for the crop discrimination. An independent accuracy assessment of the final model based on the selected predictors by the FFS procedure resulted in an overall accuracy of 76%. While most of the crop classes, achieved higher producer’s and user’s accuracies (>80%), the discrimination accuracies of potato, summer oat and winter triticale were comparatively low (<60%). Based on the outcome of the FFS, three models consisting of different predictor combinations, were further developed to ascertain the contribution of the predictors. A comparison of the models showed that the addition of phenological metrics increased the discrimination performance of the model as a whole and for cereals in particular. However, the inclusion of the topographic information did not have any significant effect on the overall model performance. Therefore, future crop type discrimination research in areas with similar terrain characteristics like Northern Hesse should reconsider the use of topographic predictors. Overall, our findings depict that the TOV modelling approach based on multi-temporal and multi-sensor data is promising for effective, accurate and practical crop type discrimination.","['Forward feature selection', 'Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2', 'Machine learning', 'Phenological metrics', 'Target oriented cross-validation']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Saskia

The resulting homogenisation of the landscape has led to a decline in bees, which provide an essential ecosystem service to agriculture. It has been suggested that an increase in landscape crop diversity supports higher biodiversity by providing more diverse and continuous resources without taking land out of agricultural production. We selected 14 faba bean (Vicia faba minor L.) fields in southern Sweden along uncorrelated gradients of landscape crop diversity and proportion of semi-natural habitat within 1.5 km radii surrounding focal fields. Pollinator surveys and pollinator exclusion experiments were conducted to assess whether landscape crop diversity affected pollinator densities, pollinator foraging behaviour (i.e. legitimate flower visitation, nectar robbing or extra-floral nectary visitation), pollination and yield formation. Landscape crop diversity enhanced bumble bee densities. Insect-pollinated faba bean plants produced, on average, 27 % higher bean weight per plant than bagged plants and the insect pollination benefit decreased with increasing semi-natural habitat cover. Bumble bee and honey bee densities, the proportion of nectar robbing bees as well as faba bean yield increased with increasing proportion of semi-natural habitat. Pollinator densities were not the driver of high yields associated with higher proportions of semi-natural habitat because the observed yield increase was unrelated to pollinator densities and driven by bagged plants that were excluded from pollinator visits. Insect pollination, however, clearly decreased the yield gap associated with low proportions of semi-natural habitat in the landscape. Our results highlight that agri-environmental policies should promote the retention of existing semi-natural habitats and encourage landscape crop diversity to provide pollinators with sufficient food and nesting resources.","['Bumble bee', 'Ecological intensification', 'Faba beans', 'Landscape crop diversity', 'Pollination', 'Pollinators', 'Semi-natural habitat']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Saskia

Flower visitors of wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g., wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14 wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their surrounding landscape context within a 500m radius (percentage arable land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were sampled in the early (May–June) and late (June–July) flowering season and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1%) of all 322 visiting species (<50.0% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241 non-prominent ‘other’ visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g. predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees, wildflower plantings support a high diversity of functionally complementary flower-visitor species from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community.","['Agri-environment scheme (AES)', 'Ecosystem services', 'Farmland biodiversity', 'Flower resources', 'Landscape', 'Restoration']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Saskia

The number of developed pods was higher on organic farms compared to conventional ones. Development of beans, which demands high pollination efficiency, increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity, but only on organic farms. Increasing proportion of ley on conventional farms did not significantly influence the development of beans. The number of developed pods was not affected by the proportion of ley in the landscape.

Several agro-environmental measures at different spatial scales have been suggested to mitigate the negative impact of intensification on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The effect of these measures on the functional structure of service-providing communities remains, however, largely unexplored. Using two distinct landscape designs, we examined how the management options of organic farming at the field scale and crop diversification at the landscape level affect the taxonomic and functional structure of generalist predator communities and how these effects vary along a landscape complexity gradient. Organic farming as well as landscapes with longer and more diversified crop rotations enhanced the activity-density of spiders and rove beetles, but not the species richness or evenness. Our results indicate that the two management options affected the functional composition of communities, as they primarily enhanced the activity-density of functionally similar species. The two management options increased the functional similarity between spider species in regards to hunting mode and habitat preference. Organic farming enhanced the functional similarity of rove beetles. Management options at field and landscape levels were generally more important predictors of community structure when compared to landscape complexity.

Landscapes could be designed to take advantage of the dependencies of pests, pathogens and their natural enemies on elements of the landscape. Yet the complexity of the interactions makes it difficult to establish general rules. In our study, we sought to characterize the impact of the landscape on pest and pathogen prevalence, taking into account both crop and semi‐natural areas. We drew on a nine‐year national survey of 30 major pests and pathogens of arable crops, distributed throughout the latitudes of metropolitan France. We performed binomial LASSO generalized linear regressions on the pest and pathogen prevalence as a function of the landscape composition in a total of 39 880 field &times; year &times; pest observation series. We observed a strong disequilibrium between the number of pests or pathogens favored (15) and disadvantaged (2) by the area of their host crop in the landscape during the previous growing season. The impact of the host crop area during the ongoing growing season was different on pests than on pathogens: the density of most pathogens increased (11 of 17, and no decreases) while the density of a small majority of pests decreased (7 of 13, and four increases). We also found that woodlands, scrublands, hedgerows and grasslands did not have a consistent effect on the studied spectrum of pests and pathogens. Although overall the estimated effect of the landscape is small compared to the effect of the climate, a territorial coordination that generally favors crop diversity but excludes a crop at risk in a given year might prove useful in reducing pesticide use.Short abstractWe sought to identify general rules characterizing the impact of the landscape on the prevalence of pests and pathogens of arable crops. We showed that the host crop area is consistently correlated with increased pressure of the pests and pathogens the following growing season. Correlations of pests and pathogens with host crop areas in the same year or with semi‐natural components of the landscape (grasslands, hedgerows and forests) are less consistent and depend on the functional traits of the organisms involved.","['Agricultural diversification', 'Arable land', 'Biodiversity', 'Climate effects', 'Conservation', 'Crops', 'Density', 'France', 'Fungicides', 'Grasslands', 'Growing season', 'Hedgerows', 'Insecticides', 'Landscape', 'Landscape design', 'Natural enemies', 'Pathogens', 'Pesticides', 'Pests', 'Woodlands', 'crop pathogens', 'crop pests', 'crop protection', 'landscape composition']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

In addition, N input and N fluxes were assessed and N2O emissions were calculated. This approach allowed identifying hot spots of N2O emissions.

In this paper we compare shadow detection on satellite imagery obtained by expert photointerpretation to a proposed automated, data-driven method. The latter automated method is a thresholding approach employing both panchromatic and multispectral imagery, where the former has a finer spatial resolution than the latter. Thresholds are determined from automatically generated training data using a risk-based approach. Comparison of the total shadow area per scene showed that more pixels were labelled as shadow by the automatic procedure than by visual interpretation. However, the union of shadow area independently identified by twelve experts on a subscene was larger than the automatically determined shadow area. The limited intersection of the shadow areas identified by the experts demonstrated that experts strongly disagreed in their interpretations. The shadow area labelled by the automated method was in between the intersection and the union of the areas interpreted by experts.

As a result, C_d__ often results in incorrect values that affect the quality of soil erosion prediction.

These changes can influence the management of cropping systems by farmers, generally leading to a decrease in crop diversity at the landscape scale and a homogenization of agricultural practices between fields, to reduce logistic costs. At the landscape scale, these changes can modify agricultural pressure on natural resources (e.g. water, soil, biodiversity), by creating hotspots of fields subject to intensive management. Consequently, natural resource management, mostly at the local scale, requires new monitoring tools dedicated to local farm dynamics.This work aimed to characterize farm area dynamics between 2007 and 2013 on the Niort Plain, a sensitive area located in the South-West of France that is subject to water and biodiversity issues. Changes in farm area were characterized, taking into account not only farm size, but also the spatial distribution of the islets included in the land pattern. The LPIS database, which provides quasi-continuous broad coverage of the French agricultural areas, was used to analyze changes in farm area, through characterization of the annual changes in farm area and their effects in terms of land fragmentation and farm size distribution.Six types of farm area dynamics were characterized: the enlargement of farms with and without a reconfiguration of the land use pattern, a decrease in the utilized agricultural area (UAA) of farms with and without a reconfiguration of the land use pattern, and a stable UAA with and without reconfiguration of the land use pattern. We found that 5.5% of the farms were either split into smaller units or stopped seeking CAP subsidies during the period considered. Two patterns predominated: a stable farm area and enlargement of the farm area. Farms of many different initial sizes displayed enlargement, generally through the acquisition of islets from another farm that was split up.Farm dynamics had a limited impact on the fragmentation of farm land. Farm enlargement led to a slight increase in the dispersion of islets from the farm center.The procedure developed here for the characterization of farm area dynamics is particularly suitable for application at the temporal scales used by planners working on environmental programs. By monitoring farm area dynamics, planners could also set specific devices to enable them to focus either on the total number of farms or exclusively on a subset of farms of strategic importance for the management of natural resources due to their area dynamics, location or aggregation in the environment.",['biodiversity ; case studies ; cropping systems ; d'],yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

We integrated occurrence data obtained from citizen-science species observation data with radio-tracking data to develop multi-level resource selection functions for the little owl (Athene noctua), a species of conservation concern in Central Europe. The results of our habitat selection analyses confirmed that suitable little owl habitat is located in widely open agricultural landscapes that often exist in the vicinity of human settlements. We mapped habitats at fine resolution (40 × 40 m) over an area covering 77,313 km2 in Switzerland and Baden-Württemberg, Germany. We validated the models with external out-of-sample data, and we demonstrated good predictive ability and transferability over the broad landscape. Overall, a fifth of the modelled landscape was estimated to be suitable for little owls. Habitat suitability scores in Switzerland were generally lower than in Baden-Württemberg due to higher elevation, fewer orchards, and more forest patches. Extant populations currently occupy c. 15% of the potential suitable habitats in Baden-Württemberg, and 2% in Switzerland, suggesting that considerable space for recolonisation is available. However, while Baden-Württemberg offers vast open landscapes, lowlands in Switzerland show narrow swaths of habitat along valleys and lakes. We showed that the simultaneous integration of different levels of habitat selection behaviour into a multi-level habitat suitability map creates a promising tool for conservation planning of endangered species over large geographical areas. Our multi-level model allowed for identification of both large-scale habitat suitability patterns to develop conservation strategies, and fine-scale clusters of high quality habitats where conservation measures can be applied at once, thereby increasing relevance of such all-in-one habitat maps for policy makers, wildlife managers and conservations practitioners alike.","['Citizen science', 'Farmland', 'Germany', 'Radio-telemetry', 'Resource selection functions', 'Scale optimisation', 'Switzerland']",yes,yes,DE / Other,yes,no,,Saskia

While their role in providing food resources to resident flower-visiting insects is unambiguous, the conservation effectiveness in a landscape context is less clear. Particularly, how multiple vs. single wildflower area utilization differs between simple and complex landscapes is understudied. We examined colonisation and community dynamics of wild bees and hoverflies in 33 newly established wildflower areas across a gradient of landscape complexity (amount of semi-natural habitat) and connectivity (presence of additional wildflower areas) for seven weeks during three consecutive years (one year during and two after establishment). We recorded more than 25% of the wild bee and hoverfly species of Hesse in an area of approx. 10 ha, substantiating the general benefit of wildflower areas to pollinators. While alpha-diversity increased with landscape complexity in isolated wildflower areas, the opposite pattern was observed for connected areas. The low alpha-diversity in complex landscapes indicated a dilution effect between connected sites. The inverse relationship between alpha and beta diversity among wildflower areas within landscapes suggests interspecific trade-offs between local resource conditions and landscape context. Accordingly, the establishment of multiple wildflower areas within AES is advisable to increase connectivity of suitable habitats in simple landscapes. Moreover, adjusting local conditions (plant diversity) to landscape context likely optimizes conservation effectiveness in modern agroecosystems.","['Agri-environment scheme (AES)', 'community structure', 'flower strips', 'flower visitors', 'landscape structure', 'syrphidae', 'wildflower plantings']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Saskia

Earlier studies have focused on how loss of foraging resources affects colony growth and thereby abundance of workers and sexual reproduction. By comparing bumblebees in agricultural landscapes of different complexity in Southern Sweden, we here demonstrate that also the adult size of bumblebee foragers is significantly related to the availability of foraging resources. This effect was independent of both species identity and foraging habitat type. This suggests a shortage of flower resources in landscapes of lower complexity, which may also affect the reproductive success of colonies negatively. Zusammenfassung Es wird angenommen, dass der negative Einfluss der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung auf Hummelpopulationen teilweise durch einen Verlust an Nahrungspflanzen hervorgerufen wird, beispielsweise wegen höherer Feldgrößen und dem damit verbundenen Verlust an Feldrändern und ihren Nektar- und Pollenpflanzen. Frühere Untersuchungen haben sich darauf konzentriert, wie der Verlust von Nahrungspflanzen das Koloniewachstum und damit Arbeiterabundanz und sexuelle Reproduktion beeinflusst. Indem wir Hummeln in südschwedischen Agrarlandschaften von unterschiedlicher Komplexität miteinander verglichen, zeigen wir, dass auch die Körpergröße von Hummelarbeiterinnen signifikant mit der Verfügbarkeit von Ressourcen verbunden ist. Dieser Effekt war unabhängig von der Artzugehörigkeit und dem Typ des Nahrungshabitats.

These factors might interactively shape crop yield, but most studies focus on only one of these factors at a time. We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.

Land cover data often are based on classification of remote sensing data that seldom provides the requisite accuracy, spatial availability and temporal observational frequency for environmental studies. Thus, there is a high demand for accurate and spatio-temporal complete time series of land cover. In the past considerable research was undertaken to increase land cover classification accuracy, while less effort was spent on interpolation techniques. The purpose of this article is to present a space–time interpolation and revision approach for remotely sensed land cover data. The approach leverages special properties known for agricultural areas such as crop rotations or temporally static land cover classes. The newly developed IRSeL-tool (Interpolation and improvement of Remotely Sensed Land cover) corrects classification errors and interpolates missing land cover pixels. The easy-to-use tool solely requires an initial land cover data set. The IRSeL specific interpolation and revision technique, the data input requirements and data output structure are described in detail. A case study in an area around the city of Neumünster in Northern Germany from 2006 to 2012 was performed for IRSeL validation with initial land cover data sets (Landsat TM image classifications) for the years 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011. The results of the case study showed that IRSeL performs well; including years with no classification data overall accuracy values for IRSeL interpolated pixels range from 0.63 to 0.81. IRSeL application significantly increases the accuracy of the land cover data; overall accuracy values rise 0.08 in average resulting in overall accuracy values of at least 0.86. Considering estimated reliabilities, the IRSeL tool provides a temporally and spatially completed and revised land cover data set that allows drawing conclusions for land cover related studies.","['Crop rotations', 'Land use change', 'Landsat', 'Remote sensing', 'Space–time interpolation']",yes,yes,DE,Yes,no,,Saskia

Landscape-level connectivity of both grassland patches and grassy linear elements actively contributes to biodiversity conservation in farmland. Nevertheless, their respective importance has rarely been tested. Butterflies form a suitable model group for this purpose; they have suffered a major overall decline in the last few decades and are known to be sensitive to landscape connectivity. We sampled 286 transects nested in 18 study landscapes in three regions. Using several metrics, we analyzed the response of butterflies to the connectivity to both grassland and woodland habitats, which may provide additional resources. The response to landscape connectivity appeared to depend on the type of the semi-natural elements (patch vs linear elements), and on species traits, i.e. the response was stronger for habitat specialists and species with low dispersal ability. We found that woody habitats close to grassland patches had a significant positive effect on butterfly communities, denoting potential mechanisms of resources supplementation and complementation. In grassy linear elements, butterfly communities were of lower conservation value, richness and abundance were much lower (−26 and −50%) than in grassland patches and decreased with isolation from grasslands, in line with the source–sink hypothesis. Although grassy linear elements probably play an important role in butterfly dispersal in agricultural landscapes, they may not be sufficient to preserve specialist and sedentary species. Conserving a mosaic of high quality grassland patches and woody habitats appears more effective than enhancing connectivity.","['Connectivity metrics', 'Conservation value', 'Dispersal ability', 'Farmland', 'Habitat specialization', 'Landscape fragmentation']",yes,yes,FR,Yes,no,,Saskia

In particular, EFSA was asked to focus on potential establishment, short‐ and long‐range spread, the length of the asymptomatic period, the impact of X.&#xa0;fastidiosa and an update on risk reduction options. EFSA was asked to take into account the different subspecies and Sequence Types of X.&#xa0;fastidiosa. This was attempted throughout the scientific opinion but several issues with data availability meant that this could only be partially achieved. Models for risk of establishment showed most of the EU territory may be potentially suitable for X.&#xa0;fastidiosa although southern EU is most at risk. Differences in estimated areas of potential establishment were evident among X.&#xa0;fastidiosa subspecies, particularly X.&#xa0;fastidiosa subsp. multiplex which demonstrated areas of potential establishment further north in the EU. The model of establishment could be used to develop targeted surveys by Member States. The asymptomatic period of X.&#xa0;fastidiosa varied significantly for different host and pathogen subspecies combinations, for example from a median of approximately 1&#xa0;month in ornamental plants and up to 10&#xa0;months in olive, for pauca. This variable and long asymptomatic period is a considerable limitation to successful detection and control, particularly where surveillance is based on visual inspection. Modelling suggested that local eradication (e.g. within orchards) is possible, providing sampling intensity is sufficient for early detection and effective control measures are implemented swiftly (e.g. within 30&#xa0;days). Modelling of long‐range spread (e.g. regional scale) demonstrated the important role of long‐range dispersal and the need to better understand this. Reducing buffer zone width in both containment and eradication scenarios increased the area infected. Intensive surveillance for early detection, and consequent plant removal, of new outbreaks is crucial for both successful eradication and containment at the regional scale, in addition to effective vector control. The assessment of impacts indicated that almond and Citrus spp. were at lower impact on yield compared to olive. Although the lowest impact was estimated for grapevine, and the highest for olive, this was based on several assumptions including that the assessment considered only Philaenus spumarius as a vector. If other xylem‐feeding insects act as vectors the impact could be different. Since the Scientific Opinion published in 2015, there are still no risk reduction options that can remove the bacterium from the plant in open field conditions. Short‐ and long‐range spread modelling showed that an early detection and rapid application of phytosanitary measures, consisting among others of plant removal and vector control, are essential to prevent further spread of the pathogen to new areas.

Balances of individual sites, regional balances and their temporal development can be calculated in geoinformation systems (GIS) using LCA methods. The composition of the substrates varies according to site and catchment area and lead to large variations in plant configurations and the resulting GHG balances and cost structures. GIS tools do not only allow the assessment of individual plants, but also the determination of the GHG reduction potential, the biogas potential as well as the necessary investment costs for entire regions.

Secondly, the article introduces measures to meet these issues by the use of map data and statistics within a geographical information system [GIS]. Finally, three case studies exemplify the application of data and methods. To deal with spatial issues of GMO EM as outlined in the VDI Guideline 4330 Part 1, a GIS-based approach is presented. It relies on both spatial data collected from several sources which were derived from sample point data and geostatistical and multivariate statistical methods within a GIS environment. Data used for describing the receiving environment and for planning and evaluating monitoring schemes comprise information about land use, climate, phenology, soil coverage, species distribution and ecoregions. The case studies deal with (1) ecological land classification for characterisation of GMO-receiving environments and representative EM, (2) selection of representative sites for modelling GMO dispersal, and (3) delineation and mapping of segregation distances. Even a systematic and stepwise-structured risk assessment cannot cover all risk relevant questions, especially large-scale, long-term and combinatory effects which may not occur before the conventional application of the respective GMO.

The robust tools of seasonal Mann-Kendall trend test and LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoothing methods were employed to reveal trends of the monitored parameters with adjustment to hydrology. Using principal component analysis and multiple regressions, statistically significant factors with highest impacts on the assessed water quality parameters were identified. Besides indicators of LULC changes in the catchments and their various zones, information of built tile drainage systems were used along with factors reflecting point pollution sources such as the population number, sewerage type and proximity to a watercourse, effectiveness of wastewater treatment, and number of livestock units. The change in LULC was essential only for NO3-N concentrations, when grassing of arable land, presence of water ponds, areas of permanent cultures and also areas of drained land explained up to 90.6 % NO3-N variability and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations showed a significantly decreasing trend in all monitored catchments during the evaluated period. LULC changes within infiltration vulnerable zones were discovered as less important for the assessed water quality parameters compared to LULC changes in the whole catchment area. However, for NH4-N, P and COD, the results did not enable a definite quantification of the effects of LULC changes. The influence of non-point pollution sources on these parameters was revealed as uncertain and was heavily overshadowed by point sources, in particular by wastewater management, and livestock numbers, although the proportion of arable land in tile drainage subcatchments was discovered fundamental in case of the COD.

Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands.

The concept of implementing priority spots for nature conservation provides an opportunity to preserve biodiversity of agricultural landscapes within highly productive areas. This approach is essentially based on two instruments that have been part of the EU's common agricultural policy (CAP) for a long time. A specific percentage of the obligatory set-aside is supposed to be assigned to nature conservation tasks. To gain maximal ecological benefit from these spots, specific conservation measures may be necessary as well.

However, there is a lack of knowledge about the consequences of the type of urban structure (e.g. monocentric vs polycentric), the shape of urban boundaries, the local density of residential development, on the habitats of wildlife species. In this context, this paper focuses on the relationship between forms of urbanisation and functional connectivity of ecological habitats. In the urban region of Besançon (eastern France), three emblematic protected species were selected to represent forest mammals. From the initial state describing current land cover, five prospective residential development scenarios were simulated, corresponding to the form currently most commonly found (e.g. compact development, transit-oriented development, polycentric development). For each scenario, we also simulate the volume of traffic on the road network to allow for the barrier effect of roads on habitat connectivity. Then, for each development scenario, we model the functional connectivity of habitats of the various target species using landscape graphs. Results show that compact city maintains more functional connectivity for all the species considered whereas urban sprawl leads to much more marked impacts. Moderately compact and regulated periurban scenarios have intermediate levels of impact. The transit-oriented development scenario produces specific impact values according to the species. An interesting point is that the decline in functional connectivity of forest habitats is more due to increased traffic than residential development proper. This outlines the relevance of integrated models for simulating both land use and transport at a fine scale.","['Computer-based simulation', 'Ecological connectivity', 'Ecological habitat', 'Landscape graphs', 'Residential development']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

It is based on convection-diffusion-reaction equations, driven by abiotic and biotic factors. The target species is the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae F., considering both its winged and apterous morphs. In this preliminary work, simulations for year 2004 (an outbreak case) produced realistic aphid densities, and showed that both spatial and temporal S. avenae population dynamics can be represented as an irregular wave of population peak densities from southwest to northeast of the country, driven by gradients or differences in temperature, wheat phenology, and wheat surfaces. This wave pattern fits well to our knowledge of S. avenae phenology. The effects of three insecticide spray regimes were simulated in five different sites and showed that insecticide sprays were ineffective in terms of yield increase after wheat flowering. After suitable validation, which will require some further years of observations, the model will be used to forecast aphid densities in real time at any date or growth stage of the crop anywhere in the country. It will be the backbone of a decision support system, forecasting yield losses at the level of a field. The model intends then to complete the punctual forecasting provided by older models by a comprehensive spatial view on a large area and leads to the diminution of insecticide sprayings in wheat crops.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","['11114:Wheat Farming', '1540:Pollution control', '32532:Pesticide and Other Agricultural Chemical Ma', '8400:Agriculture industry', '8640:Chemical industry', '9130:Experimental/theoretical', '9175:Western Europe', 'Agricultural production', 'Animals', 'Aphids -- growth & development', 'Cereals', 'Crop diseases', 'Crops', 'Environmental Studies--Pollution', 'Environmental science', 'Epidemics', 'France', 'Immigration', 'Insect Control -- methods', 'Insecticides', 'Insects', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Partial differential equations', 'Phenology', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Population Dynamics', 'Software', 'Spatio-Temporal Analysis', 'Studies', 'Triticum -- growth & development', 'Triticum -- physiology', 'Wheat']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

Rural landscapes have undergone dramatic changes leading to homogenized landscapes.ObjectivesIn this study, we investigated how landscape composition, structure and connectivity impact butterfly communities according to their ecological and biological traits.MethodsWe made use of 5669 Lepidoptera surveys performed at 4525 distinct locations in lowland Central France. We considered 19 ecological groups based on habitat specialization, mobility, diet, voltinism or overwintering strategy. Generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to relate the species richness of these groups to landscape variables defined in circular zones with radius from 250&#xa0;m to 5&#xa0;km.ResultsRichness of most species groups co-varied with landscape variables, with the exception of mobile, imago-overwintering, monophagous and polyphagous species. Habitat proportion explained more variation in butterfly diversity than habitat connectivity or habitat diversity. Moreover, the best proportion models were generally found for the 250-m circular zones. Thirteen species groups were disfavored by cropland amount. Except for forest specialists and high mobility group, no other group was more diverse in landscapes dominated by a single land cover type. Rather, for total diversity and 14 groups, species richness peaked for forest proportions varying between 40 and 80%, and for total diversity and nine groups for grassland proportions ranging from 30 to 60%.ConclusionsThese results indicate that landscape homogenization is contributing to the ongoing decline in butterflies, and support preserving and (re)creating mosaics of grasslands and forests.","['Agricultural land', 'Animal behavior', 'Biodiversity', 'Butterflies & moths', 'Distribution atlas', 'Environmental Studies', 'Farming', 'Farming intensification', 'Forests', 'Grasslands', 'Habitat connectivity', 'Habitats', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Landscape', 'Landscape simplification', 'Mathematical models', 'Mobility', 'Mosaics', 'Overwintering', 'Rural areas', 'Specialization', 'Species diversity', 'Species richness', 'Species traits', 'Urban areas', 'Voltinism']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

This process was forced by agronomical innovations, market preferences and specialist food processing chains and resulted in the dominance of a few cash crops and short-term management plans. Classical crop rotation patterns became uncommon while short rotations and flexible sequence cropping characterize the standard crop rotation practice. The great variety and flexibility in cropping management as a reaction to economic demands and climatic challenges complicate the systematization of crop rotation practice and make historical systematization approaches less suitable. We present a generic typology approach for the analysis of crop rotation practice in a defined region based on administrative time series data. The typology forgoes the detection of fixed defined crop rotations but has its focus on crop sequence properties and a consideration of the main characteristics of crop rotation practice: i) the transition frequency of different crops and ii) the appropriate combination of crops with different physical properties (e.g. root system, nutritional needs) and growing seasons. The presented approach combines these characteristics and offers a diversity-related typology approach for the differentiation and localization of crop sequence patterns. The typology was successfully applied and examined with a data set of annual arable crop information available in the form of seven-year sequences for Lower Saxony in the north-western part of Germany. About 60% of the investigated area was cropped with the ten largest crop sequence types, which represent the full range of crop pattern diversity from continuous cropping to extreme diversified crop sequences. Maize played an ambivalent role as driver for simplified rotation practice in permanent cropping on the one hand and as element of diversified sequences on the other hand. It could be verified that the less diverse crop sequence types were more strongly related to explicit environmental and socioeconomic factors than the widespread diverse sequence types.

VHSR Land Cover classification, in particular, is currently a well-established tool to support decisions in several domains, including urban monitoring, agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental assessment. Additionally, land cover classification can be employed to annotate VHSR imagery with the aim of retrieving spatial statistics or areas with similar land cover. Modern VHSR sensors provide data at multiple spatial and spectral resolutions, most commonly as a couple of a higher-resolution single-band panchromatic (PAN) and a coarser multispectral (MS) imagery. In the typical land cover classification workflow, the multi-resolution input is preprocessed to generate a single multispectral image at the highest resolution available by means of a pan-sharpening process. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown the advantages of avoiding data preprocessing by letting machine learning algorithms automatically transform input data to best fit the classification task. Following this rationale, we here propose a new deep learning architecture to jointly use PAN and MS imagery for a direct classification without any prior image sharpening or resampling process. Our method, namelyMultiResoLCC, consists of a two-branch end-to-end network which extracts features from each source at their native resolution and lately combine them to perform land cover classification at the PAN resolution. Experiments are carried out on two real-world scenarios over large areas with contrasted land cover characteristics.

These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10days.

The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014.

The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal profiles of fields with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key findings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described.

In this regard, the synergy of optical and Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables a broad representation of biophysical and structural information on target objects, enhancing crop type mapping. However, the fusion of multi-sensor dense time-series data often comes with the challenge of high dimensional feature space. In this study, we (1) evaluate how the usage of only optical, only SAR, and their fusion affect the classification accuracy; (2) identify the combination of which time-steps and feature-sets lead to peak accuracy; (3) analyze misclassifications based on the parcel size, optical data availability, and crops’ temporal profiles. Two fusion approaches were considered and compared in this study: feature stacking and decision fusion. To distinguish the most relevant feature subsets time- and variable-wise, grouped forward feature selection (gFFS) was used. gFFS allows focusing analysis and interpretation on feature sets of interest like spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), or data sensing time rather than on single features. This feature selection strategy leads to better interpretability of results while substantially reducing computational expenses. The results showed that, in contrast to most other studies, SAR datasets outperform optical datasets. Similar to most other studies, the optical-SAR combination outperformed single sensor predictions. No significant difference was recorded between feature stacking and decision fusion. Random Forest (RF) appears to be robust to high feature space dimensionality. The feature selection did not improve the accuracies even for the optical-SAR feature stack with 320 features. Nevertheless, the combination of RF feature importance and time- and variable-wise gFFS rankings in one visualization enhances interpretability and understanding of the features’ relevance for specific classification tasks.

We evaluated how crop diversity and availability of semi-natural grasslands at a landscape-scale interacted with local farming management (three management types from low to high intensity: ley<winter wheat<sugar beet) in their effect on ground beetle assemblages in southern Sweden. Ground beetle diversity increased with crop diversity either independently of local management (Simpson species diversity), or only in the less intensively managed habitats (rarefied species richness). While ground beetle diversity in leys tended to increase with field boundary length, no such relationship was observed in winter wheat or sugar beet fields. In contrast, the landscape proportions of leys and semi-natural grasslands did not affect ground beetle species richness and diversity. We conclude that (a) semi-natural grasslands and leys may not function as source habitats at a landscape-scale if they comprise a low proportion of the total land-use, while (b) increasing crop diversity is correlated to ground beetle richness and diversity in agricultural landscapes dominated by arable land. The beneficial effect of landscape-scale crop diversification on farmland biodiversity may depend on the general level of agricultural intensity of a region. Zusammenfassung Man nimmt an, dass Anbaudiversifizierung und der Erhalt von halbnatürlichen Habitaten (Grasländer und Feldraine) die Biodiversität im Agrarland steigern, aber die relative Bedeutung der beiden Faktoren ist weitgehend unbekannt. Wir untersuchten in Südschweden, wie die Anbaudiversität und die Verfügbarkeit von halbnatürlichen Grasländern auf der Landschaftsebene mit der lokalen Bewirtschaftung (drei Bewirtschaftungsweisen von geringer bis hoher Intensität: Grasland<Winterweizen<Zuckerrübe) interagierten und die Laufkäfergemeinschaften beeinflussten. Die Laufkäferdiversität stieg mit der Anbaudiversität entweder unabhängig von der lokalen Bewirtschaftung (Simpson-Diversität) oder nur auf den weniger intensiv bewirtschafteten Flächen (rarifizierter Artenreichtum). Während die Laufkäferdiversität auf Grasländern tendenziell mit der relativen Feldrandlänge zunahm, konnte für Winterweizen und Zuckerrübe keine solche Beziehung beobachtet werden. Dagegen beeinflussten die Flächenanteile der Grasländer und der halbnatürlichen Habitate Artenreichtum und Diversität der Laufkäfer nicht. Wir schließen, dass (a) halbnatürliche Habitate und Grasländer nicht als Quellhabitate auf der Landschaftsebene fungieren könnten, wenn sie einen geringen Anteil an der genutzten Fläche ausmachen, während (b) zunehmende Anbaudiversität mit dem Artenreichtum und der Diversität der Laufkäfer in von Ackerflächen dominierten Agrarlandschaften korreliert sind.

Sentinel-2 and Landsat provide observations of similar nature and offer the opportunity to combine both data sources to increase time-series temporal frequency at high spatial resolution. Multi-sensor image compositing is one way for performing pixel-level data integration and has many advantages for processing frameworks, especially if analyses over larger areas are targeted. Our compositing approach is optimized for narrow temporal-intervals and allows the derivation of time-series of consistent reflectance composites that capture field level phenologies. We processed more than a year's worth of imagery acquired by Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. We used all data acquired over Germany and integrated observations into composites for three defined temporal intervals (10-day, monthly and seasonal). Our processing approach includes generation of proxy values for OLI in the MSI red edge bands and temporal gap filling on the 10-day time-series. We then derive a national scale crop type and land cover map and compare our results to spatially explicit agricultural reference data available for three federal states and to the results of a recent agricultural census for the entire country. The resulting map successfully captures the crop type distribution across Germany at 30 m resolution and achieves 81% overall accuracy for 12 classes in three states for which reference data was available. The mapping performance for most classes was highest for the 10-day composites and many classes are discriminated with class specific accuracies >80%. For several crops, such as cereals, maize and rapeseed our mapped acreages compare very well with the official census data with average differences between mapped and census area of 11%, 2% and 3%, respectively. Other classes (grapevine and forest classes) perform slightly less well, likely, because the available reference data does not fully capture the variability of these classes across Germany. The inclusion of the red edge bands slightly improved overall accuracies in all cases and improved class specific accuracies for most crop classes. Similarly, our gap filling procedure led to improved mapping accuracies when compared to nongap-filled 10-day features. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of approaches that utilize data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat which allows for detailed assessments of agricultural and other land-uses over large areas.","['Agriculture', 'Compositing', 'Crop mapping', 'Land cover', 'Land-use', 'Phenology, large-area mapping', 'Red edge', 'Time series']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Saskia

Monitoring data of the Common Breeding Bird Survey of Lower Saxony, Germany, and high-resolution data on agricultural land use from 2005 to 2012 were used to calculate the temporal trend slopes of farmland birds and agricultural variables at the landscape scale (1km2). Agricultural variables comprised the area covered by maize, set-aside, permanent grassland as well as crop diversity. The number of territories were analysed for all farmland birds together as well as for two subgroups (‘field nesters’ and ‘non-field nesters’). Further, we tested whether population trends of farmland birds differed between agricultural regions, characterised by different land-use change dynamics. Trends of farmland birds and non-field nesters were negatively related to increasing maize cultivation at the landscape scale. We further found that population trends of field nesters reacted region-specifically and performed worst in an agricultural region that was characterised by the strongest increase of maize and decrease of crop diversity, indicating a negative effect of broad-scale landscape homogenisation. To counteract the process of spatial and temporal land-use homogenisation and to inform policy-makers on options for mitigation, we conclude that conservation actions should be tailored at a regional scale to halt or even reverse negative farmland bird population trends.","['Bioenergy', 'Bird monitoring', 'Common agricultural policy', 'Conservation', 'Farmland biodiversity', 'Maize']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Saskia

The indicators were processed in a multi-criteria context using principal component analysis, which, based on the spatial layout pattern of the indicators, assigns weights of importance. These weights were then subsequently used to calculate the aggregation index, which indirectly indicates the sensitivity of the area to degradation and, in particular, water retention. Two catchment areas of the 3rd order - ÄŒíÅ¾ina and Kyjovka - with different soil, climatic and economic conditions were selected for the study. Among the indicators of water retention in the landscape, our analysis included the share of agricultural land in the total area, the share of arable land, the average size of the field block, soil degradation according to the degradation model, runoff curve number, potential water erosion and surface drainage. The resulting procedure can be used to evaluate smaller areas.

Widespread degradation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems has triggered the establishment of ecological observatories, including the Zone Atelier Armorique (ZAAr) in western France, a part of the International Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) network. The ZAAr includes a patchwork of land covers and uses, including old-growth forests, intensively cultivated row crops, and ancient bocage fields surrounded by hedgerows. In addition to traditional ecological research at ZAAr, the last 8&#xa0;years have seen the development of multiproxy and multiscale approaches to address surface and groundwater quality. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of this 8-year dataset, including vegetation, soil water storage, and stream and groundwater chemistry. We observed contrasting responses of different catchment components to climate forcing and direct disturbance. Our results highlight a clear relationship between land use and surface water quality, while groundwater quality appeared largely unrelated to land use, suggesting strong differences in aquifer nitrogen removal rates. There were large differences in nutrient fluxes among dry and wet years, with multiyear memory effects apparent for some parameters. Given such complex interactions, including emergent dynamics and decadal to centennial time lags, we conclude that multidimensional observations such as those supported by the ZAAr and other LTSER sites, are critical to understanding ecohydrological systems in the Anthropocene.","['Anthropogenic forcing', 'Aquatic ecosystems', 'Aquifers', 'Case studies', 'Catchment scale', 'Catchments', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem resilience', 'Ecosystem vulnerability', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental degradation', 'Fluxes', 'France', 'Groundwater', 'Groundwater chemistry', 'Groundwater quality', 'Groundwater storage', 'Hedgerows', 'Heterogeneity', 'Intensive farming', 'Interaction parameters', 'Land use', 'Landscape', 'Long-term monitoring', 'Moisture content', 'Multiproxy', 'Multiscale', 'Multiscale methods', 'Nitrogen removal', 'Nutrient cycles', 'Nutrient loading', 'Nutrients', 'Observatories', 'Organic chemistry', 'Pollution load', 'Soil water', 'Soil water storage', 'Surface water', 'Surface-groundwater relations', 'Terrestrial environments', 'Water quality', 'Water storage']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Saskia

It emerged that wastewater treatment plant effluent is the main emission pathway for carbamazepine (98.5% referring to the total released annual load) and land runoff (98%) for sulfamethoxazole.

This often leads to disparate results among studies suggesting that the investigation of agriculture-biodiversity relationships suffers from scale-dependence, information redundancy, non-linearity problems, and thus, unpredictability. Here, we propose a multi-scale and multi-facet approach to clarify the impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity and possible mitigating actions. Our study is based on bird and agricultural practice surveys of 199 agricultural fields in three agricultural regions of France. Using landscape characteristics and agricultural practice variables, we disentangled four main gradients of agricultural intensification on our study sites: landscape opening (farmland expansion), landscape homogenization (decrease in crop and land cover diversity), chemical intensification (fertilizer, insecticide, and fungicide), and tillage vs. herbicide. We tested whether and how these gradients interacted with each other at field, farm and regional levels in shaping taxonomic diversity (alpha, gamma and beta diversity) and ecological responses of bird communities (relative proportion of specialist vs. generalist species, trophic categories). Landscape homogenisation and opening affected the taxonomic and ecological responses of birds at field and farm levels, but not at the regional level, highlighting the scale-dependence of agriculture–biodiversity relationships. At field and farm levels, landscape opening had a positive effect on beta diversity, and community specialization by enabling the existence of farmland specialists, while heterogeneous landscapes promoted generalists. Chemical intensification had negative impacts, especially at the farm level and on almost all facets of diversity. However, some bird species seemed to tolerate higher levels of both chemical and tillage intensification. Some important interaction effects between landscape and agricultural practices, which are often disregarded, were also revealed, such that landscape homogenization in interaction with tillage reduction was correlated with higher specialization. The field level appeared mostly relevant for explaining community variations by habitat and resource availability. Meanwhile at the coarsest scale, i.e., the Small Agricultural Region, only some possible dispersal limitations were likely to occur. Finally, our results highlight the farm level (intermediate scale) as a relevant unit for management and agricultural policies, since the community responded to both landscape and agricultural practices intensification at this level. In particular, we emphasize the necessity to conserve both heterogeneous and homogeneous agricultural landscapes under extensive practices; the former promotes taxonomic diversity, when the latter favors specialized farmland biodiversity.","['Agricultural intensification', 'Crop practices', 'Farmland bird diversity', 'Landscape homogenisation', 'Scales', 'Species traits']",yes,yes,FR,y,no,,Saskia

The effects of yield and demand uncertainties and the farmer's risk aversion on the optimal decisions of the production quantity, wholesale price and retail price are analyzed. Our analyses provide managerial insights on the contract terms of the agricultural supply chain. We show that the production quantity decreases as the farmer is more risk-averse and faces higher yield uncertainty, while the retail price subsequently increases. However, the wholesale price is influenced by the interaction effect of the farmer's risk aversion and yield uncertainty. The retail price is influenced by the interaction effect of demand uncertainty and price elasticity. In particular, we show that the loss due to the decentralized decisions increases as the farmer is more risk-averse and yield uncertainty is higher. Thus, a RPG (Revenue sharing + Production cost sharing + Guaranteed money) mechanism is developed to facilitate the coordination of the agricultural supply chain under uncertainty environment with risk-averse agents based on contract farming practices. The cost allocation ratio of the RPG mechanism borne by the agribusiness firm increases in the yield and market demand uncertainties and decreases in the farmer's risk aversion. Specially, if the farmer is extremely risk averse, as well as the yield and demand becomes extremely higher, the RPG mechanism cannot achieve perfect coordination of the agricultural supply chain.

The most frequently used references for information sharing are time and location. In order to understand the requirements, fundamental processes, and core information concepts of a domain, a comprehensive, but standardised documentation is needed. In spatial data infrastructures models presented in Unified Modelling Language (UML) are widely used to facilitate the uptake of standards and valorise best practices of various communities.The European agricultural decision makers must deal with many components described in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in order to optimize data integration and achieve transparency. Geospatial information plays a key role in the implementation of this policy, which comprises the establishment and maintenance of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS).In the past the IACS of the MS has principally served a single high level business case: to run a correct administration of the CAP. However, the recent reform and the synergies with environmental and societal policies create increasing expectations for IACS, which impact upon system interoperability and data usability. These objectives can be achieved by establishing a framework that is standard based, allows flexible extensions, and that supports efficient implementation and information exchange between the stakeholders.This paper presents the development process and describes the structure of a domain model we propose for IACS. This standard driven model was designed to translate requirements into technical elements, ensuring interoperability, and providing flexible extensions at the same time. For this purpose we set-up a formal requirement model, formalized use cases, and integrated ISO/TC 211 and INSPIRE UML based class diagrams. As such, this paper proposes a methodology to help guide how the policy can be implemented.The importance of traceability from IACS and third party business rules to the information concepts was proven by simulation runs. The developed modelling approach yielded a reference for conformance testing, indicated critical points of potential errors, and highlighted the impact of eventual changes. Storing all concepts and implementation options of IACS in a unique framework helps to eliminate redundant efforts, provides a strong basis for developing various applications, underpins interoperability with other domains and -enhances transparency of the CAP.

A set of data, collected from 2012 to 2017 in a maize-growing area, especially on deep loess soils in the South Moravia Region, was used to analyse the morphological characteristics of the ephemeral gullies (EGs). The relationship was confirmed between the ephemeral gully (EG) length and the size of its contributing drainage area in accordance with studies conducted in other countries. It is also important that the closest relationship was confirmed between the length of the gully and its calculated volume.

Focal fields were situated along a gradient of landscape complexity.

In addition, all flowers on half of the bagged and open-pollinated plants were pollinated by hand to measure the degree of pollen limitation.

The pollination experiment showed that the number of beans per pod was lower in bagged plants compared with other treatments in one of the years, but the lower number of beans per pod was compensated for by a higher individual bean weight, such that there was no pollinator-dependency or effect of hand pollination on total bean mass per plant.

Over recent decades, a widely observed population decline occurred, which was attributed to agricultural intensification. However, with political incentives for specific crops, especially maize for energy production, the habitat went through massive changes. Thus, there is the need to identify parameters that characterize a suitable habitat for the brown hare in today's agricultural lands. Results We modelled European brown hare densities spatially and temporally explicit over 10 years (2005-2014) across an entire federal state. The generalized additive mixed model confirms a constant decline of the European brown hare population in Lower Saxony. Municipalities with a high proportion of grassland and precipitation totaling up to 900 mm are more favored. Woodland showed an approximately linear negative effect. The most important agricultural crop groups such as winter grains and winter oilseed rape showed overall positive effects on hare densities. However, the effect of maize was unimodal, with a positive effect of medium proportions, but a negative effect of very high proportions. The effect of sugar beet was relatively weak but negative. Brown hares were also more abundant in municipalities with a higher density of vixen with litter and municipalities with a high proportion of wildflower strips showed higher brown hare abundance. Conclusion Lower Saxony is a diverse federal state with grassland dominated areas in the northwest, more woodland in the east, but intensive arable land in most remaining areas. The European brown hare-a species with a wide ecological potency-shows preferences to both grassland and the most typical arable crop groups such as winter grains and winter oilseed rape. The substantial increase in maize production within the time frame was likely unfavourable and may be one reason for the decline. Nonetheless, political tools such as the agri-environmental scheme ""wildflower strips"" were beneficial for the brown hare abundance and may be an option to reverse the decline seen over the 10 years.

Landscape pattern indices (LPIs) are tools appropriate for analyzing landscape spatial patterns. LPIs are often derived from raster land cover maps that are extracted from remotely sensed data through hard classification. However, pixel-based hard classification methods suffer from the mixed pixel problem (in which pixels contain more than one land cover class), making for inaccurate classification maps and LPIs. In addition, LPIs generated by hard classification methods are characterized by grain sizes (the sampling unit sizes) that limit the derived landscape pattern to a certain scale. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) models can enable fine-scale estimation of the spatial patterns of land cover classes without requiring additional data; hence, this is an appropriate downscaling method for land cover mapping. The fraction images generated by soft classification estimate the area proportion of each land cover class within each pixel, and using these images as input enables SPM models to alleviate the mixed pixel problem. At the same time, by transforming fraction images into a finer-scaled hard classification map, SPM models can minimize the influence of grain size on LPIs calculation. In this research, simulated landscape thematic patterns that can provide different landscape spatial patterns, eight commonly used LPIs and a SPM model that maximizes the spatial dependence between neighbouring sub-pixels were applied to assess the efficiency of deriving LPIs from sub-pixel model maps. Results showed that the SPM model can more precisely characterize landscape patterns than hard classification methods can. Landscape fragmentation, class abundance, the uncertainty in SPM, and the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data influenced LPIs derived from sub-pixel maps. The largest patch index, landscape division, and patch cohesion derived from remotely sensed data with different spatial resolutions through the SPM model were suitable for inter-comparison, whereas the patch density, mean patch area, edge density, landscape shape index, and area-weighted mean shape index derived from the sub-pixel maps were sensitive to the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data.",['cohesion ; land cover ; landscape management ; lan'],no,no,?,yes,yes,dataset,Stefan

For the assessment of the LULC legacy effect on landslide occurrences, we used generalized additive models (GAM) within a suitable modeling framework considering various settings of LULC as predictor, and evaluated the effect with well-established diagnostic tools. For both municipalities, we identified a high density of landslides on present-day forested areas, confirming the reported drawbacks.

The aim of our study is to find the most suitable variables for the detection of grassland to cropland change, based on a pair of high resolution images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite and from the vector database Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). In total, 59 variables were used to create models using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), the quality of which was verified through multi-temporal object-based change detection. Satisfactory accuracy for the detection of grassland to cropland change was achieved using all of the statistically identified models. However, a three-variable model can be recommended for practical use, namely by combining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wetness and Fifth components of Tasselled Cap. Increasing number of variables did not significantly improve the accuracy of detection, but rather complicated the interpretation of the results and was less accurate than detection based on the original Landsat 8 images.

Already for longer period of time, indicators have been used as assessment criteria in landscape planning to support decisions regarding land use. Due to the standards the EU commission requires from the member states in this regard, the application of indicators to assess the effects of agri-environment programs have gained prominence. The EU requires proof of the achievement of the promotion aims such as soil (erosion, nutrients, plant-protective agents), water, bio-diversity and landscape (EU/VO 12004/00). This commitment can be met by means of a functioning environmental reporting. However, only an insufficient number of suitable indicators exist in the fields of bio-diversity and landscape.

The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates. The mapped mowing patterns depict typical management regimes across Germany. Overall, our results exemplify the value of multi-sensor time series applications for characterizing land use intensity across large areas.","['Agriculture', 'CAP', 'Compositing', 'Europe', 'Grassland', 'Land use intensity', 'Phenology', 'Time series analysis']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Stefan

A lack of long-term monitoring data and insufficient ecological knowledge of pest insects limit our possibilities to characterize drivers of change in their abundances. We demonstrate how a suite of complementary methods and data sources can be used to analyse historical shifts in pest abundance and species composition when continuous monitoring data for pest insects and their natural enemies are lacking. We compared historic and current abundances of seed weevils (Protapion spp.) in red clover fields grown for seed in southernmost Sweden using data from 60 fields 1935–1937 and 53 fields 2008–2011 respectively. We found higher pest abundances in the current data, and parasitism rates provided by wasps appeared to be lower in recent times compared with the 1930s. A separate analysis of 1504 observations of the insect pest species made 1936–2012 and reported into a public database showed that a formerly subdominant seed weevil species, Protapion trifolii L. has now become the dominating pest species, whereas Protapion apricans Hbst. became relatively less common over time. This shift correlated with increased spring temperatures in the study area. Finally, we analysed if the proportion farmland in the surrounding landscape, temperature, precipitation and distance to nearest clover field in the previous year could explain pest abundances 2008–2011. We found that fields with less precipitation that were embedded in landscapes with a high proportion of farmland at the 5km radius had higher pest abundances. Our results combined suggest that landscape scale changes in agricultural land use and increased spring temperatures both have contributed to the increased pest abundances observed 2008–2011 compared to 1935–1937. This study illustrates that a combination of approaches can compensate for the common situation when continuous long-term monitoring data is lacking, and improve our understanding of historic versus current insect pest abundances and the potential drivers of change.","['Pest control', 'spp']",yes,yes,SE,yes,yes,,Stefan

This article investigates the extent to which digital technologies can trigger different choices of agricultural policy instruments and novel design specifications that address problems of sustainability in farming more effectively and possibly more efficiently. It develops and applies an analytical framework that focuses on the effects of digitalisation in distinct policy dimensions, drawing on theoretical insights and examples from practice in a European context. We show that digital agricultural policy does not simply replace analogue technologies used in traditional agricultural policy. It offers new options for agricultural policy, including novel designs to address challenges more effectively. In particular, it offers opportunities for more effective spatial targeting and tailoring of instruments, including results-based subsidies. Digital data can be generated strategically using respective instrument designs to support policy learning and adaptation of designs. Information-intensive instruments and designs generally benefit most from digitalisation while transaction costs often go down. Digitalisation could also move agricultural policy from direct intervention to information-based governance. However, the analysis suggests that institutional constraints and interests, as well as the capabilities of the actors involved require attention in research and practice of digitalisation of agricultural policy.","['Agricultural policy', 'Digitalisation', 'Information and communication technology', 'Policy design', 'Policy instrument choice']",no,no,?,yes,yes,dataset,Stefan

In a multi-model approach, we compared the explanatory power of present and historical landscape variables and habitat quality on diversity patterns.ResultsThe change in landscape configuration had no effect on the species richness of forest plants in hedgerows, i.e. there was no sign of an extinction debt. The best explanatory variable was the hedgerow width with more species found in wider hedgerows. This demonstrates the importance of including local habitat variables in the study of extinction debt. For ancient woodland indicator species models including both the landscape configuration and habitat variables were superior to simple models. The best models included the historical distance to the nearest forest, suggesting an extinction debt. Counterintuitively, a high density of hedgerows had a negative influence on species richness, most likely because hedgerows are narrower in areas with higher densities due to land-saving measures by farmers.

A three-step method was applied to the entire area of metropolitan France (543,940 km²). First, land-use and land-cover maps—including grasslands—were produced for each year from 2006–2017 using the random forest classification of MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products, which were calibrated and validated using field observations. Second, grassland frequency from 2006–2017 was calculated by combining the 12 annual maps. Third, sub-pixel analysis was performed using a reference layer with 20 m spatial resolution to quantify percentages of land-use and land-cover classes within MODIS pixels classified as grassland. Results indicate that grasslands were accurately modeled from 2006–2017 (F1-score 0.89–0.93).

However, spatial patterns in agricultural landscapes vary significantly across the Earth resulting in different imagery requirements depending on what part of the globe is observed. Furthermore, there is an increasing diversity of Earth observation instruments providing imagery with various configurations of spatial, temporal, spectral and angular resolutions. In terms of spatial resolution, the choice of imagery should be conditioned by knowing the appropriate spatial frequency at which the landscape must be sampled with the imaging instrument in order to provide the required information from the targeted fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework to define quantitatively such requirements for both crop area estimation and crop growth monitoring based on user-defined constraints. The methodological development is based on simulating how agricultural landscapes, and more specifically the fields covered by a crop of interest, are seen by instruments with increasingly coarser resolving power. The results are provided not only in terms of acceptable pixel size but also of pixel purity which is the degree of homogeneity with respect to the target crop. This trade-off between size and purity can be adjusted according to the end-user's requirements. The method is implemented over various agricultural landscapes with contrasting spatial patterns, demonstrating its operational applicability. This diagnostic approach can be used: (i) to guide users in choosing the most appropriate imagery for their application, (ii) to evaluate the adequacy of existing remote sensing systems for monitoring agriculture in different regions of the world and (iii) to provide guidelines for space agencies to design future instruments dedicated to agriculture monitoring.","['Agricultural monitoring', 'Crop area estimation', 'Crop growth monitoring', 'Pixel Purity', 'Point Spread function', 'Spatial resolution']",yes,yes,BE / FR / CN / NL / NG,Yes,no,,Stefan

To assist farmers in this process, we develop the web-based, open source decision support system ‘Fruchtfolge’ (German for ‘crop rotation’). It provides decision makers with a crop and coarse manure fertilization management recommendation for each field based on the solution of a single farm optimization model. The optimization model accounts for field specific location factors, labor endowments, field-to-farm distances and policy restrictions such as measures linked to the EU Nitrates Directives and the Greening of the EU Common Agricultural Policy. ‘Fruchtfolge’ is user-friendly by automatically including big data related to farm, location and management characteristics and providing instant feedback on alternative management choices. This way, creating a first optimal cropping plan generally requires less than five minutes. We apply the decision support system to a German case study farm which manages fields outside and inside a nitrate sensitive area. In the year 2021, revised fertilization regulations come in force in Germany, which amongst others lowers maximal allowed nitrogen applications relative to crop nutrient needs in nitrate sensitive areas. The regulations provoke profit losses of up to 15% for the former optimal crop rotation. The optimal adaptation strategy proposed by ‘Fruchfolge’ diminishes this loss to 10%. The reduction in profit loss clearly underlines the benefits of our support tool to take optimal cropping decisions in a complex environment. Future research should identify barriers of farmers to apply decision support systems and upon availability, integrate more detailed crop and field specific sensor data.","['Big data', 'Decision Support System', 'Farm level simulation model', 'Fertilization Ordinance', 'Nitrates Directive']",yes,yes,DE,Yes,no,,Stefan

We analysed the effect of environmental (soil erosion, rainfed yield potential), structural (farm education, age, pluriactivity, diversification, rented agricultural land), technical (yield ratio) and contextual (gross domestic product per capita, population density) factors on labor productivity. Significant differences were revealed between northern-central regions and the continental peripheries (Mediterranean, Eastern). Soil erosion negatively affects agricultural labour productivity; for each one ton/ha increase in the modelled annual soil erosion rate the odds of regions to attain high labour productivity decreased by 28%. The importance of technical efficiency in crop production was also identified. Observed low wheat yields, relative to modelled potential yields, in the southern, eastern and northern European regions indicate a large unexploited gap. The positive effect of the regional gross domestic product per capita and the low population density confirmed the importance of contextual factors on labour productivity. A second analysis of a composite indicator of the labour productivity of the European agricultural systems, which accounted for the productivity of each system without considering its size, revealed the positive effect of farm education and the negative effect of pluriactivity on agricultural labour productivity. The analyses indicate the importance of compensatory allowances for areas facing natural constraints, while investing in farm training schemes and advisory services could increase the adoption of new technologies and improve the performance of farmers in both economic and environmental terms. Finally, the significance of contextual factors indicates the importance of a better harmonisation of rural development policy with regional policy.","['Agricultural labour productivity', 'Farm education', 'Multilevel logistic regression model', 'Soil erosion', 'Technical efficiency', 'Water limited yield potential']",no,no,?,Yes,yes,dataset,Stefan

There is even less land management and soil moisture data, which are needed to track climate change mitigation activities since soil moisture is one of the main drivers of GHG emissions of organic soils. Information is also needed for the reporting of land-based activities such as grazing land management or wetland drainage and rewetting of organic soils. Different spatial and thematic resolutions of land-use data produce inconsistent time series with a strong overestimation of land-use change (LUC) if not adequately accounted for. Our aim was to create a consistent time series of land use since 1990 that is in line with GHG reporting under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol by combining official cadastral data with colour-infrared aerial photography used for biodiversity monitoring in six federal states in northern and eastern Germany. We developed a generic hierarchical classification by land use, management and drainage status, and a translation key for data harmonisation into a consistent time series. This time series enabled the quantification of LUC on organic soils between 1992 and 2013 in a spatially explicit manner. Furthermore we used this time series to develop indicators for changes in land management and drainage to evaluate the success of protection statuses on peatland restoration. The study area encompassed one million hectares, half of which had some type of legal nature protection status. Areas with no protection status tended to become more intensively farmed and drier, while highly protected areas (e.g. Natura 2000) showed the opposite trend. Land-use trends also differed greatly between federal states. In Schleswig-Holstein organic soils tended to become drier during the study period, while in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they tended to become wetter overall. The trends and differences in LUC between federal states were linked to German reunification, changes in the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Germany's Renewable Energy Act (EEG). A large-scale peatland protection programme also had major impact. In conclusion, our study demonstrates how data derived for biodiversity monitoring and other highly detailed land-use data can be used to track changes in land use, management and drainage status in accordance with the reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.","['Greenhouse gas inventory', 'Kyoto Protocol', 'Land-use change', 'Peatland', 'Rewetting', 'Time series consistency']",no,no,DE,Yes,yes,dataset,Stefan

Therefore, in order to assess the extent of frost damage in the agricultural sector, the objective of this study is to build an operational approach capable of detecting frozen plots at the plot scale in a near real-time scenario using Sentinel-1 (S1) data. C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data show high potential for the detection of freeze/thaw surface states due to the significant alterations to the dielectric properties of the soil, which are distinctly observable in the backscattered signal. In this study, we propose an approach that relies on change detection in the high-resolution Sentinel-1 C-band SAR backscattered coefficients, to determine surface states at the plot scale as either frozen or unfrozen. A threshold analysis is first performed in order to determine the best thresholds for three distinct land cover classes, and for each polarization mode (VH, and VV). S-1 SAR data are then used to detect a plot’s surface state as either unfrozen, mild-to-moderately frozen or severely frozen. A temperature-based filter has also been applied at the end of the detection chain to eliminate false detections in the freezing detection algorithm due mainly to rainfall, irrigation, tillage, or signal noise. Our approach has been tested over two study sites in France, and the output results, using either VH or VV, compared qualitatively well with both in situ air temperature data and soil temperature data provided by ERA5-Land. Overall, our algorithm was able to detect all freezing episodes over the analyzed S-1 SAR time series, and with no false detections. Moreover, given the high-resolution aspect of S-1 SAR data, our algorithm is capable of mapping the local variation of freezing episodes at plot scale. This is in contrast with previous products that only offer coarser results across larger areas (low spatial resolution).","['Air temperature', 'Algorithms', 'Backscattering', 'C band', 'Change detection', 'Crops', 'Dielectric properties', 'Economic impact', 'Electrical properties', 'Europe', 'Freeze-thawing', 'Freezing', 'Frost', 'Frost damage', 'High resolution', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Mapping', 'Northern Hemisphere', 'Permafrost', 'Physics', 'Radar', 'Radiometers', 'Rainfall', 'Real time', 'Seeds', 'Sensors', 'Sentinel-1', 'Soil properties', 'Soil temperature', 'Soils', 'Spatial discrimination', 'Spatial resolution', 'Synthetic aperture radar', 'Temperature', 'Tillage', 'Time series', 'Vegetation', 'agricultural areas', 'frozen/unfrozen', 'plot scale', 'radar', 'real-time']",yes,yes,FR,Yes,no,,Stefan

Despite such abundance of information, it is not always possible to obtain a complete coverage of the same area (especially for large ones) from all the different sensors due to: (i) atmospheric conditions and/or (ii) acquisition cost. In this context of data (or modalities) misalignment, only part of the area under consideration could be covered by the different sensors (modalities). Unfortunately, standard machine learning approaches commonly employed in operational Earth monitoring systems require consistency between training and test data (i.e., they need to match the same information schema). Such a constraint limits the use of additional fruitful information, i.e., information coming from a particular sensor that may be available at training but not at test time. Recently, a framework able to manage such information misalignment between training and test information is proposed under the name of Generalized Knowledge Distillation (GKD). With the aim to provide a proof of concept of GKD in the context of multi-source Earth Observation analysis, here we provide a Generalized Knowledge Distillation framework for land use land cover mapping involving radar (Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) satellite image time series data (SITS). Considering that part of the optical information may not be available due to bad atmospheric conditions, we make the assumption that radar SITS are always available (at both training and test time) while optical SITS are only accessible when the model is learnt (i.e., it is considered as privileged information). Evaluations are carried out on a real-world study area in the southwest of France, namely Dordogne, considering a mapping task involving seven different land use land cover classes. Experimental results underline how the additional (privileged) information ameliorates the results of the radar based classification with a main gain on the agricultural classes.","['Agricultural management', 'Classification', 'Context', 'Distillation', 'Geography', 'Information management', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Lidar', 'Machine learning', 'Mapping', 'Misalignment', 'Radar', 'Remote sensing', 'Remote sensors', 'Satellite imagery', 'Satellites', 'Sensors', 'Temporal resolution', 'Training']",yes,no,FR,Yes,yes,plot-level,Stefan

To halt bee declines, it is essential that conservation actions are based on a mechanistic understanding of how bee species utilize landscapes. We aimed at teasing apart how foraging resources in the landscape through the nesting season affected nesting and reproduction of a solitary bee in a farmland region. We investigated how availability of floral resources and potentially resource‐rich habitats surrounding nests affected nest provisioning and reproduction in the solitary polylectic bee Osmia bicornis. The study was performed in 18 landscape sectors dominated by agriculture, but varying in agricultural intensity in terms of proportion of organic crop fields and seminatural permanent pastures. Pasture‐rich sectors contained more oak (Quercus robur), which pollen analysis showed to be favored forage in early season. More oaks ≤100 m from nests led to higher proportions of oak pollen in nest provisions and increased speed of nest construction in early season, but this effect tapered off as flowering decreased. Late‐season pollen foraging was dominated by buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), common in various noncrop habitats. Foraging trips were longer with more oaks and increased further through the season. The opposite was found for buttercup. Oak and buttercup interacted to explain the number of offspring; buttercup had a positive effect only when the number of oaks was above the mean for the studied sectors. The results show that quality of complex and pasture‐rich landscapes for O. bicornis depends on preserving existing and generating new oak trees. Lignose plants are key early‐season forage resources in agricultural landscapes. Increasing habitat heterogeneity with trees and shrubs and promoting suitable late‐flowering forbs can benefit O. bicornis and other wild bees active in spring and early summer, something which existing agri‐environment schemes seldom target.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural resources', 'Bees', 'Biology', 'Crop fields', 'Crops', 'Flowering', 'Foraging habitats', 'Forbs', 'Habitats', 'Landscape', 'Landscape preservation', 'Nest provisioning', 'Nesting', 'Nests', 'Oak', 'Offspring', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Pasture', 'Plants (botany)', 'Pollen', 'Pollination', 'Provisioning', 'Quercus robur', 'Ranunculus', 'Reproduction', 'Shrubs', 'Trees', 'agri‐environment schemes', 'central‐place forager', 'farmland biodiversity', 'organic farming', 'pollen foraging', 'pollinator', 'red mason bee']",yes,yes,SE,Yes,no,,Stefan

A major difference between the models were different assumptions of specific runoff variations between different land-use classes. These differences had a considerable effect on the computed source apportionment.

In the European Union (EU), societal demands to include environmental conservation concerns within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have resulted in the recognition of the importance of maintaining High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf). HNVf constitute complex social-ecological systems, which owe their nature conservation value to the maintenance of specific, mostly low-intensity farming systems, supporting high levels of species and habitats dependent on agricultural practices. Even though HNVf assessment in space and time is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of Rural Development Programmes, the diversity of rural landscapes across EU, the scarcity of data on farming systems, and the lack of common methodological guidelines has hampered the implementation of HNVf mapping and monitoring across Europe. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and test methodological approaches that may support HNVf assessment across the EU.The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) which is mandatory for all EU Member States constitutes a system for the management and control of CAP payments to farmers. Essentially, IACS comprises high-resolution, spatially explicit information on the type and intensity of agricultural land-use. Even though such data exhibits high thematic, spatial and temporal resolution, IACS has seldom been used, due to significant access restrictions. Here, the potential to use IACS data to support the assessment of HNVf was evaluated within the German Federal State of Lower Saxony by implementing a recently developed methodological framework. Sets of indicators known to be essential for identifying potential HNVf and underlying farming systems (expressing landscape structure and composition, farming systems, and crop diversity), were derived from IACS. Spatial patterns of indicators were analyzed at two different scales to delineate the potential distribution of HNVf across Lower Saxony. Results highlighted that most regions in Lower Saxony were characterized by intensive farming practices including high livestock density, high share of intensive crops and low density of linear elements.Only 3% of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) of Lower Saxony potentially constituted HNVf, with the majority of HNVf coinciding with mosaics of arable and/or permanent crops and semi-natural features under less intensive farming practices. Semi-natural grasslands, partially under agri-environment scheme management contracts, covered roughly 1% of the UAA and were mostly intermingled with other farmland habitats in extensively managed agricultural landscapes.",['Agro-biodiversity ; Common Agricultural Policy (CA'],yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Stefan

Flower strips can increase the abundance and sometimes the diversity of bumble bees at local scales, but the importance of flower strips for bumble bee populations at larger scales remains poorly understood. We investigated the effect of flower strips on bumble bee colony growth and reproduction at landscape scales. Commercial bumble bee colonies of a native species (Bombus terrestris) were placed and monitored at different distances from flower strips that were sown on existing ecological focus areas (European Common Agricultural Policy) in southern Sweden. Both the average colony growth (weight) and the production of reproductives (drones and queens) were highest for colonies adjacent to flower strips and declined with increasing distance. Colonies close to the flower strip also produced more reproductives per colony weight. Colony foraging activity was negatively related to the distance to flower strips whereas worker size was not affected. Annual flower strips in ecological focus areas benefit bumble bee colonies by increasing foraging success, colony growth and finally boosting sexual reproduction, demonstrating potential benefits for pollination within and between seasons. These effects were spatially limited but extended to foraging ranges of bumble bees. However, effects of increased colony growth on the abundance of foraging bees in the landscape may extend to larger distances because of forager movements within seasons and queen dispersal between seasons, suggesting that voluntary or incentivised collaboration between farmers may be needed to achieve optimal implementation of flower strips.","['Agri-environmental schemes', 'Bombus', 'Bumble bee colony development', 'Ecological focus areas', 'Floral resources', 'Reproductive success']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Stefan

This system was established in the 1960–1980s after a complex survey of agricultural land. It provided integral information on the agricultural land quality and on the price of agricultural land parcels derived from their productive capacity. Starting from the 1990s, evidence in the database of Evaluated Soil-Ecological Units (ESEU) has been regularly updated. Intensive cultivation of wide-spaced crops, namely in extended, largely sloped land parcels, has resulted in degradation of land characteristics by the effects of erosion. The ESEU updating makes it possible to detect these changes and their quantification by differences in land price. This approach was applied to evaluate the economic impacts of erosion at two model localities in intensively exploited agricultural areas, in the region of the most productive soils of the Czech Republic. We compared the price per 1 m2 of land according to the land characteristics determined by the first land valuation with the current soil price based on the ESEU update. We also compared changes in the land characteristics. In the GIS environment, we established the mean long-term soil loss by erosion based on the original ESEU and compared it with the calculated soil loss based on the updated ESEU.

The models WaTEM/SEDEM, USPED, InVEST and TerrSet work on several different algorithms. The model outputs are compared in terms of the total volume of eroded and accumulated sediment within the catchment per time unit, and further according to the spatial distribution of sites susceptible to soil loss or sediment accumulation.

In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution of multispectral satellite imagery (optical and radar) to land use and land cover classification. Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm, and majority zoning post-processing are used. This study emerges from the experiment on multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10, Baup et al., 2012) conducted in 2010 on a mixed farming area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. This experiment enabled the regular and quasi-synchronous collection of multi-sensor satellite data and in situ observations, which are used in this study. 211 plots with contrasting characteristics (different slopes, soil types, aspects, farming practices, shapes and surface areas) were monitored to represent the variability of the study area. They can be grouped into four classes of land cover: 39 grassland areas, 100 plots of wheat, 13 plots of barley, 20 plots of rapeseed, and 2 classes of bare soil: 23 plots of small roughness and 16 plots of medium roughness. Satellite radar images in the X-, C- and L-bands (HH polarization) were acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010. Optical images delivered by Formosat-2 and corresponding field data were acquired on 14 April 2010. The results show that combining images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and the optical range (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy = 0.85, kappa = 0.81) compared to the use of radar or optical data alone. The results obtained for the various types of land cover show performance levels and confusions related to the phenological stage of the species studied, with the geometry of the cover, the roughness states of the surfaces, etc. Performance is also related to the wavelength and penetration depth of the signal providing the images.

It has been suggested that local management interventions to promote natural enemies are most successful in simple landscapes that are dominated by large arable fields. Objectives We study how farming category (conventional, new and old organic fields) and landscape complexity affect pests, natural enemies and biological control services in spring barley. We further analyse if yields are related to pest infestation or biological control services. Methods The amount of pasture and the length of field borders were used to define landscape complexity around barley fields in Southern Sweden. Arthropods were sampled with an insect suction sampler and predation and parasitism services were estimated by field observations and inspections of pest individuals. Results Pest infestation was affected by landscape complexity, with higher aphid, but lower leafhopper numbers in more complex landscapes. Aphid predation was higher under organic farming and affected by effects on predator abundance and community composition independent of landscape complexity. Auchenorrhyncha parasitism was neither significantly affected by landscape complexity nor by farming category. Higher aphid predation rates and lower aphid densities were characteristic for organically managed fields with higher barley yields. Conclusions Our results suggest that it is possible to increase both aphid biological control services and barley yield via local management effects on predator communities independent of landscape complexity.

The reference spatial units for spatial modeling are 57 within-field areas named ""reference zones"" (RZs) homogeneous for their soil properties, constructed in the vicinity of 57 roughness measurement locations, spread across 20 agricultural fields for which TOs were known. The total RZ dataset was half dedicated to successive random selections of training/validating RZs, the remaining half (29 RZs) being kept for validating the final map results. Five supervised per-pixels classifiers were used in order to map 2 TOs classes (seedbed&harrowed and late winter plough) in addition to 4 landuse classes (forest, urban, crops and grass, water bodies): support vector machine with polynomial kernel (pSVM), SVM with radial basis kernel (rSVM), artificial neural network (ANN), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and regression tree (RT). All 5 classifiers were implemented in a bootstrapping approach in order to assess the uncertainty of map results. The best results were obtained with pSVM for the SPOT4/ASAR pair with producer's and user's mean validation accuracies (PmVA/UmVA) of 91.7%/89.8% and 73.2%/73.3% for seedbed&harrowed and late winter plough conditions, respectively. Whatever classifier, the SPOT4/ASAR pair appeared to perform better than each of the single images, particularly for late winter plough: PmVA/UmVA of 61.6%/53.0% for the single SPOT4 image; 0%/6% for the single ASAR image. About 73% of the validation agricultural fields (79% of the RZs) were correctly predicted in terms of TOs in the best pSVM-derived final map. Final map results could be improved through masking non-agricultural areas with land use identification system layer prior to classifying images.

The empirical results indicated that Saxony-Anhalt was advanced in BPD, while farmers’ response from Bavaria to EEG was the weakest. The reason behind could be the differences in farmers’ personality traits and risk cognitions toward the biogas production investment. The spatial analysis indicated that Saxony-Anhalt had more severe environmental problems caused by the biogas production expansion than Bavaria. Therefore, to promote BPD in states such as Bavaria, an increase in the nationwide unified subsidy might lead to an overreaction of the EEG strong response states, e.g., Saxony-Anhalt, leading to more serious environmental problems.

The negative effect of high land-use intensity on biodiversity on agricultural land could be confirmed. The concept of farming styles, which integrates human attitudes, farming objectives and economic success can be used to show the different ecological performances of farmers. A close link between mentality of farmers, land-use intensity and biodiversity could be established. Farmers who were highly production oriented supported the lowest nature values on their land, whereas both traditionally oriented and innovative farm businesses carried a higher potential to farm in concordance with the biodiversity of their landscape.

BINATS was implemented on 100 test areas (625 m &times; 625 m) which were selected based on a stratified random sampling design from all across the Austrian agricultural landscape with a focus on maize and oilseed rape cultivation. For each test area, the distribution of different habitat structures was mapped, and the species number of vascular plants, the species number and abundance of butterflies and grasshoppers, as well as the abundance of potential hybridisation partners of oilseed rape were recorded on ten randomly distributed sampling sites (circles, radius 20 m). Implementing BINATS resulted in a consistent database of the biodiversity and habitat configuration across parts of the Austrian agricultural landscapes. These data provide a baseline against which future biodiversity trends and their relationship with eventual GMP cropping can be evaluated. Moreover, they serve for assessing site-specific biodiversity-related risks of GMP cropping even in advance of their release. Finally, the first monitoring cycle (2007 and 2008) revealed insights into both the significance and the limits of such a monitoring program and allowed for a realistic calculation of the associated costs. Regular reassessments of the BINATS network will provide valuable insights into the change of biodiversity in Austrian agricultural landscapes and their potential drivers. BINATS was specifically designed to collect such information at comparatively low costs. However, the BINATS approach is flexible enough to include additional indicators or monitoring objects to take account for future insights into their particular relevance in a GMP cropping context. The results obtained from the first BINATS cycle could not yet be correlated with GMP impacts since GMPs have not been commercially released in Austria so far. In this aspect, BINATS still needs to prove its suitability to relate biodiversity changes to GMP cropping. But it is intended to repeat the survey of the BINATS data in regular reassessments to improve our knowledge about the general biodiversity trends in agricultural landscapes free of GMP cropping. These baseline data should help to relate GMP-specific effects on biodiversity in future.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",['Environmental Studies'],yes,yes,AT,y,no,,Stefan

A novel approach for the calculation of WB was employed, which combined the FAO-56 method for crop water requirements (CWRs) with sources of available water from precipitation, soil, and groundwater. The computed WB was divided into four categories of soil water availability based on soil hydrolimits and crop features: Categories 1 and 2 with zero or mild occurrence of crop water stress; categories 3 and 4 with intermediate and severe occurrence of crop water stress. The winter crops were affected by water stress to a lesser extent (the area of categories 3 and 4: wheat 20.1%, oilseed rape 14.5%) as compared with spring crops (the area of categories 3 and 4: maize 39.6%, potatoes 41%). The highest water deficit was recorded for all crops in the maize-AGA due to low precipitation and high CWRs. Most available water was revealed to occur in the mountain-AGA. A strong need for the adoption of measures towards the optimization of water regimes on agricultural land was indicated. The present study shows a promising approach for evaluating and proposing changes of area of cultivated crops with the appropriate tillage and agricultural water management in terms of satisfactory crop water requirements.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural management', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Categories', 'Cereal crops', 'Climate change', 'Corn', 'Crops', 'Czech Republic', 'Environmental Studies', 'Groundwater', 'Hydrology', 'Irrigation', 'Moisture content', 'Mountains', 'Optimization', 'Potatoes', 'Precipitation', 'Rapeseed', 'Soil water', 'Soils', 'Tillage', 'Water availability', 'Water balance', 'Water deficit', 'Water management', 'Water regimes', 'Water requirements', 'Water shortages', 'Water stress', 'Water supply', 'Wheat', 'Winter wheat', 'crop water requirements', 'maize', 'oilseed rape', 'potatoes', 'soil water availability', 'winter wheat']",yes,no,CZ,y,yes,plot-level,Stefan

While some countries provide public statistics on wild plants, others seem to neglect wild plant gathering and commercialization. In this study, we aimed to understand if wild plant commercialization is neglected or irrelevant in Austria, a country that does not provide statistics. We focus on organic producers, because organic certification of wild plant gathering might have potential for countering frequent concerns about commercial gathering, including destructive gathering and overharvesting. Using a mixed-methods approach with a concurrent triangulation design, databases of six organic certification bodies were analysed concurrently with semi-structured expert interviews of their representatives. We found that organic certification for gathering was issued to 1.5% of organic producers in the year 2016 in Austria and is relevant for three distinct gatherer types: regular, diversified, and single-plant gatherers. Organic gathering is most frequently part of agricultural or horticultural farms and rarely an isolated commercial activity. It is related to mixed farming, deepening on-farm diversification, and contributes to maintaining traditions, as well as the local socio-ecological memory of wild plant products. Organic wild plants are directly marketed to consumers as traditional and innovative products, but also supplied to mass markets. We conclude that from a socio-cultural perspective and a focus on regional economies, organic gathering is neglected in Austria, whereas from an income perspective, wild plant gathering seems to be indeed relevant for few organic producers, although exhibiting potential.","['Agriculture', 'Albania', 'Austria', 'Certification', 'Commercialization', 'Data collection', 'Environmental Studies', 'Europe', 'Farmers', 'Farms', 'Finland', 'Flowers & plants', 'Fruits', 'Herbs', 'Mushrooms', 'Poland', 'Regional development', 'Statistics', 'Tourism', 'Traditions', 'Triangulation', 'foraging', 'health food', 'neglected and underutilized species', 'non-timber forest product', 'organic farming', 'superfood', 'traditional knowledge', 'wild edible plant', 'wild food']",yes,no,AT,y,yes,plot-level,Stefan

The influence of crop rotation on C value and on erosion rate is often determined on an experimental plot scale, so the results are often erroneous when extrapolated to large heterogeneous landscapes, where they fail to capture the spatiotemporal variability beyond the experimental sites. In the present study we have endeavored to investigate the impact of various crop rotation patterns on C value and on subsequent soil erosion rate, at a landscape level, by combining 28 time-series satellite images (from 2013 to 2016) along with annually updated land-use data, via the integrated administration and control system (IACS), from the Uckermark district of north eastern Germany. In total, 21 different crop sequences were investigated. Winter wheat (WW), winter rape (WR), and maize (Mz) were found to be the predominant arable crops grown in the study area. The highest average annual C values were estimated from crop sequences involving Mz and sugar beet (SB), both as pre-crops and succeeding crops. The highest value of 0.39 was computed from SB/Mz rotation. On the other hand, crop rotation involving WR gave significantly lower annual C values in all the years considered, with the lowest average annual C value of 0.07 calculated on WR parcels preceded by winter cereals. It was also apparent that crop rotation patterns influenced C value in a temporally variable manner. Among the self-sequencing patterns, WR/WR reduced the C value significantly compared with Mz/Mz and to a lesser extent compared with WW/WW. Continuous cultivation of Mz increased the potential soil loss rate by as much as 72 % compared to WR/WR and by 51 % compared to WW/WW. It was also possible to determine the spatial distribution of the impact of crop rotation on soil erosion risk within the study area. The results obtained agreed with the results of other international and regional studies. Overall, the output from this research could contribute towards further efficient investigation of the impact of agronomic practices on the environment in a large agricultural landscape, without the need to set up multi-location experimental plots.",['Brassica napus ; agricultural land ; agricultural'],yes,yes,DE,y,no,,Stefan

Along with rainfall erosivity, soil coverage by vegetation or crop residues is the most dynamic factor affecting soil erosion. Parcel-specific soil coverage information can be derived by satellite imagery with high geometric resolution. However, their usable number is mostly, due to cloud cover, not representative for the phenological characteristics of vegetated classes. To overcome temporal constraints, spatial and temporal fusion models, such as STARFM, are increasingly applied to derive high-resolution time series of remotely sensed biophysical parameters, based on fine spatial/coarse temporal resolution imagery, such as Landsat, and coarse spatial/fine temporal resolution imagery, such as MODIS. In this context, the current study introduces an evaluation scheme for simulated vegetation index time series which enables the assessment of their performance during multiple phenological phases. The evaluation scheme is based on Germany-wide available spatial predictions of phenological phases as well as RapidEye imagery and parcel-specific crop-type information. The evaluation results show that the simulation accuracy is basically controlled by the temporal distance between MODIS and Landsat base pairs, as well as the ability of the actual Landsat image to properly represent the phenological phase of the Landsat image simulated by MODIS. In addition, we discuss the potential of simulated index times series and corresponding phenological information for the dynamic (1) definition of temporal windows where soils are potentially covered by no, sparse or dense vegetation or crop residues and (2) parameterization of soil erosion models. The database thus obtained opens up new possibilities for an efficient and dynamic erosion monitoring, which can support soil protection and hazard prevention.","['Monitoring', 'NDVI', 'Phenology', 'STARFM', 'Soil cover', 'Soil erosion']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

These greening measures (including fallows and permanent grasslands) have been criticised for their potential inability to conserve biodiversity and promote associated ecosystem services. In this study, we investigate if the presence of old or recently established fallows and permanent grassland in the landscape are beneficial for the emergence, activity density and spillover of ground-running natural enemies and as a result aphid biological control in cereal fields. Lycosidae and Theridiidae were more numerous in fallows (emergence & activity density) compared to crop fields, while Staphylinidae and Linyphiidae showed opposite patterns. Spillover of Lycosidae was significantly higher from fallows into cereal fields, than between cereal fields. As a result of the opposite patterns in activity density in fallows between different groups of predators, a spillover from fallows did not result in a significantly higher aphid control in crop fields adjacent to them. A high proportion of permanent grassland in the landscape resulted in lower emergence of Linyphiidae and Carabidae. Our results support the assumption that a higher emergence and activity density of ground-running predators generally results in higher spillover to adjacent fields. However, patterns of emergence and activity density differed between individual natural enemy groups. Fallows, independent of age, can therefore act as source or sink depending on the focal predator group and more permanent grassland in the landscape can result in lower local emergence. Fallows at the local scale and permanent grassland at larger spatial scales therefore did not generally promote aphid biological control services provided by ground-running natural enemies.","['Emergence', 'Fallow', 'Generalist predators', 'Permanent grassland', 'Set-aside', 'Spillover']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Andreas

To quantify these changes, distributed hydrological modelling tools able to simulate the hydrology of periurban catchments are being developed. Land cover information is one of the data sources used to define the model mesh and parameters. The land cover in periurban catchments is characterized by a very large heterogeneity, where the vegetated and the artificial surfaces are finely overlapping. The study is conducted in the Yzeron catchment (150km2), close to the city of Lyon, France. We explore the potential of very high-resolution (VHR) optical images (0.50–2.50m) for retrieving information useful for those distributed hydrological models at two scales. For detailed object-oriented models, applicable to catchments of a few km2, where hydrological units are based on the cadastral units, manual digitizing based on the 0.5m resolution image, was found to be the most accurate to provide the required information. For larger catchments of about 100km2, three semi-automated mapping procedures (pixel based and object-oriented classifications), applied to aerial images (BD-Ortho®IGN), and two satellite images (Quickbird and Spot 5) were compared. We showed that each image/processing provided some interesting and accurate information about some of the land cover classes. We proposed to combine them into a synthesis map, taking profit of the strength of each image/processing in identifying the land cover classes and their physical properties. This synthesis map was shown to be more accurate than each map separately. We illustrate the interest of the derived maps in terms of distributed hydrological modelling. The maps were used to propose a classification of the Yzeron sub-catchments in terms of dominant vegetation cover and imperviousness. We showed that according to the image processing and images characteristics, the calculated imperviousness rates were different. This can lead to significant differences in the hydrological response.","['Distributed hydrological model', 'Image processing methods', 'Impervious surface', 'Land cover mapping', 'Very High Resolution images']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Andreas

However, how bee communities respond varies and is still unclear. To date, few studies have used precise descriptors to understand these effects. Our aim was to understand the respective and complementary influences of different wooded and herbaceous habitats on wild bee communities. We selected thirty 500-m radius landscapes on a gradient of a percentage of wooded SNH in south-western France. At each landscape, we sampled wild bees in spring 2016 and plants in spring 2015 and 2016 at the forest edge, in a hedgerow, and in a permanent grassland. Pollen carried by the most abundant bee species was collected and identified. Using beta diversity indices, we showed that wild bee community composition differs between the three SNH types, and especially between herbaceous and wooded SNH. Based on Jacobs’ selection index, we showed that pollen of some plant species recorded in wooded SNH are preferentially selected by wild bees. Studying the impact of the loss of each SNH type on the global bee-pollen interaction network, we found that wooded SNH contributed to its resilience, enabling specific plant–bee interactions. Overall, our results underline the non-negligible contribution of wooded SNH to the diversity of wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and thus the importance of maintaining different types of SNH.","['Agricultural land', 'Bees', 'Biodiversity', 'Biology--Entomology', 'Community composition', 'Diversity indices', 'Flowers & plants', 'Grasslands', 'Habitats', 'Hypotheses', 'Landscape', 'Plant reproduction', 'Pollen', 'bee communities', 'interaction network', 'permanent grasslands', 'pollen', 'semi-natural habitats', 'wild bees', 'wooded habitats']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Andreas

Game managers need to be aware of the possible effects of different management tools on wild pheasant populations. We used data from 38 hunting grounds collected over an 8-year period (2004-2011) and generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) to assess whether pheasant harvest was related to the habitat characteristics and game management practices (release of hand-reared individuals and predator control) in the Czech Republic. The proportion of grasslands, idle lands (spontaneously set-aside lands), and organically farmed lands (i.e., with limited use of industrially made fertilizers and pesticides) and the density of watercourses were positively related to the pheasant harvest. The proportion of forests and road density showed a negative relationship with the pheasant harvest. An important effect of year on the pheasant harvest was also found. In terms of game management practices, predator control intensity (i.e., foxes, martens, corvids) was positively related to the pheasant harvest. The release of hand-reared individuals was not included in the final GLMMs. Our study suggests that the best long-term strategy to reinforce the wild population of ring-necked pheasants would be to concentrate on habitat improvement through the implementation of set-aside management, maintaining the right percentage of shrubby and grass vegetation, to continue with targeted predator control, and to reduce the costly practice of releasing of hand-reared individuals.","['Animal Welfare', 'Czech Republic', 'Habitats', 'Predation', 'Wildfowl', 'Wildlife management']",yes,yes,CZ,yes,no,,Andreas

The proposed method provides access to an inventory of potential N2O emissions (the term potential refers to possible but not yet actual) at a fine scale, with an annual update, without a heavy deployment linked to a collection of field measurements. The processing chain is applied to optical satellite images regularly acquired at a high spatial resolution during the 2006–2015 period, allowing a better spatial and temporal resolution of the estimates of potential N2O emissions from crops. The yearly potential N2O emissions inventory is estimated over a study site located in southwestern France, considering seven main seasonal crops (i.e., wheat, barley, rapeseed, corn, sunflower, sorghum and soybean). The first step of the study, that is the land use classification, is associated with accurate performances, with an overall accuracy superior to 0.81. Over the study area, the yearly potential budget of N2O emissions ranges from 97 to 113 tons, with an estimated relative error of less than 5.5%. Wheat, the main cultivated crop, is associated with the maximum cumulative emissions regardless of the considered year (with at least 48% of annual emissions), while maize, the third crop regarding to the allocated area (grown on less than 8% of the study site), has the second highest cumulative emissions. Finally, the analysis of a 10-year map of the potential N2O budget shows that the mainly observed crop rotation (i.e., alternating of wheat and sunflower) reaches potential emissions close to 16 kg N2O emitted per hectare, while the monoculture maize is associated with the maximum value (close to 28.9 kg per hectare).","['Aerosols', 'Agricultural land', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agriculture', 'Anthropogenic factors', 'Budgets', 'Cereal crops', 'Classification', 'Corn', 'Crop rotation', 'Crops', 'Cultivation', 'Deployment', 'Emission inventories', 'Emissions', 'Fertilizers', 'France', 'Gases', 'Grain cultivation', 'Greenhouse effect', 'Greenhouse gases', 'Helianthus', 'Image acquisition', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Land use classification', 'Mapping', 'Maps', 'Meteorology', 'Monoculture', 'N2O emissions', 'Nitrogen', 'Nitrous oxide', 'Observatories', 'Rapeseed', 'Remote sensing', 'Resolution', 'Satellite imagery', 'Satellite sensing', 'Satellites', 'Soils', 'Sorghum', 'Soybeans', 'Spatial discrimination', 'Spatial resolution', 'Sunflowers', 'Temporal resolution', 'Wheat', 'classification', 'optical images', 'random forest']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Andreas

Their pollination is best secured if both managed honey bees and wild pollinators are present in the agricultural landscape. Semi-natural habitats are known to be the main foraging and nesting areas of wild pollinators, thus benefiting their populations, whereas crops flowering simultaneously may competitively dilute pollinator densities. In our study we asked how landscape structure affects major pollinator groups’ visiting frequency on 36 focal sunflower fields, hypothesising that herbaceous semi-natural (hSNH) and sunflower patches in the landscape neighbourhood will have a scale-dependent effect. We found that an increasing area and/or dispersion of hSNH areas enhanced the visitation of all pollinator groups. These positive effects were scale-dependent and corresponded well with the foraging ranges of the observed bee pollinators. In contrast, an increasing edge density of neighbouring sunflower fields resulted in considerably lower visiting frequencies of wild bees. Our results clearly indicate that the pollination of sunflower is dependent on the composition and configuration of the agricultural landscape. We conclude that an optimization of the pollination can be achieved if sufficient amount of hSNH areas with good dispersion are provided and mass flowering crops do not over-dominate the agricultural landscape.","['Crops', 'Flowering', 'Helianthus', 'Plant reproduction', 'Pollination', 'Pollinators', 'Sciences: Comprehensive Works']",?,?,Hungary,yes,yes,Study area is in Hungary,Andreas

The overall aim of this paper is to provide an analysis of the implementation process and selected outcomes of the policy-driven instrumental innovation of FMS. In particular, the objectives are i) to reveal how and with what success the introduction of FMS has been realised in Germany and ii) to analyse and discuss the FMS′ adoption in the federal state of Brandenburg. For the first part of the study, we elaborate a situational analysis of the policy implementation through a desk study and expert interviews. In the second part, selected results from a farmers' survey in Brandenburg are presented and a switching regression model is developed to assess the factors responsible for the uptake of FMS and to understand the role of FMS in improving the confidence in complying with Cross Compliance regulations. We found a high degree of diversity among FMS developed in the different federal states. FMS adoption rates varied, but were generally low. Institutional environment seems to have a significant influence as the same FMS had very different adoption rates among federal states.

However, counterfactual scenario analysis proved that especially farmers who did not adopt FMS would have benefitted most if they had adopted the tool. Our study shows that there is a need for systems supporting farmers in dealing with bureaucratic requirements. Future FMS should be easy to understand, adaptable to individual farmers' needs and be available at low costs. Furthermore, there is a need to design FMS in a participatory way that integrates farmers' expectations.","['Common Agricultural Policy', 'Cross Compliance', 'Environmental management', 'FAS', 'FMS', 'Farm Advisory System']",no,no,GE,yes,yes,no IACS data used,Andreas

Current agricultural landscapes are poor in flowers resources for bumble bees. Available forage crops are predominantly early-season mass-flowering crops (MFC). It has been suggested, but not tested, that scarcity of late-season flower resources are limiting bumble bee populations. We examined whether addition of late-season flowering red clover affected worker, queen and male bumble bee densities. Bumble bees were surveyed in flower-rich uncultivated field borders across 24 landscapes (radius 2km) with or without a clover field in the centre, varying in semi-natural grassland (SNG) and early MFC availability. Clover fields had over ten times higher worker densities compared to field borders, suggesting red clover as favoured forage. Five times more queens and 71% more males were found in landscapes with clover fields compared to control landscapes, despite these fields constituting less than 0.2% of the landscape area. Both MFC and SNG increased the density of males, but only in the presence of clover fields. Our results suggest that late-flowering red clover positively affects bumble bee reproduction, likely by increasing temporal resource continuity. Interventions such as flower strips can thus have mitigating effects if they release population regulation by late-season resource bottle-necks.","['Flower resources', 'Mitigation measure', 'Pollinator', 'Reproductive success']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Andreas

The objectives were to (1) develop a methodology to predict individual crop species or or management regimes; (2) investigate the earliest time point in the growing season when the species predictions are satisfactory; and (3) to present a method to assess the uncertainty of the predictions at an individual field level. Seventeen Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes (VV and VH polarizations) acquired in interferometric wide swath mode from 14 May through to 30 August 2017 in the same geometry, and selected based on the weather conditions, were used in the study. The improved k nearest neighbour estimation, ik-NN, with a genetic algorithm feature optimization was tailored for classification with optional Sentinel-1 data sets, species groupings, and thresholds for the minimum parcel area. The number of species groups varied from 7 to as large as 41. Multinomial logistic regression was tested as an optional method. The Overall Accuracies (OA) varied depending on the number of species included in the classification, and whether all or not field parcels were included. OA with nine species groups was 72% when all parcels were included, 81% when the parcels area threshold (for incorporating parcels into classification) was 0.5 ha, and around 90% when the threshold was 4 ha. The OA gradually increased when adding extra Sentinel-1 scenes up until the early August, and the initial scenes were acquired in early June or mid-May. After that, only minor improvements in the crop recognition accuracy were noted. The ik-NN method gave greater overall accuracies than the logistic regression analysis with all data combinations tested. The width of the 95% confidence intervals with ik-NN for the estimate of the probability of the species with the largest probability on an individual parcel varied depending on the species, the area threshold of the parcel and the number of the Sentinel-1 scenes used. The results ranged between 0.06–0.08 units (6–8% points) for the most common species when the Sentinel-1 scenes were between 1 June and 12 August.

However, although gas exchange between croplands and the atmosphere is measurable in the field, it is difficult to quantify at the plot scale over relatively large areas because of the heterogeneous character of landscapes and differences in crop management. However, assessing accurate carbon and water budgets over croplands is essential to promote sustainable agronomic practices and reduce the water demand and the climatic impacts of croplands while maintaining sufficient yields. From this perspective, we developed a crop model, SAFYE-CO2, that assimilates high spatial- and temporal-resolution (HSTR) remote sensing products to estimate daily crop biomass, water and CO2 fluxes, annual yields, and carbon budgets at the parcel level over large areas. This modeling approach was evaluated for sunflower against two in situ datasets. First, the model’s output was compared to data acquired during two cropping seasons at the Auradé integrated carbon observation system (ICOS) instrumented site in southwestern France. The model accurately simulated the daily net CO2 flux (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.97 gC·m−2·d−1 and determination coefficient (R2) = 0.83) and water flux (RMSE = 0.68 mm·d−1 and R2 = 0.79). The model’s performance was then evaluated against biomass and yield data collected from 80 plots located in southwestern France. The model was able to satisfactorily estimate biomass dynamics and yield (RMSE = 66 and 54 g·m−2, respectively). To investigate the potential application of the proposed approach at a large scale, given that soil properties are important factors affecting the model, a sensitivity analysis of two existing soil products (GlobalSoilMap and SoilGrids) was carried out. Our results show that these products are not sufficiently accurate for inclusion as inputs to the model, which requires more accurate information on soil water retention capacity to assess water fluxes. Additionally, we argue that no water stress should be considered in the crop growth computation since this stress is already present because of remote sensing information in the proposed approach. This study should be considered a first step to fulfill the existing gap in quantifying carbon budgets at the plot scale over large areas and to accurately estimate the effects of management practices, such as the use of cover crops or specific crop rotations on cropland C and water budgets.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agricultural production', 'Agronomy', 'Atmospheric models', 'Biogeochemical cycles', 'Biomass', 'Carbon', 'Carbon dioxide', 'Climate change', 'Computer simulation', 'Corn', 'Cover crops', 'Crop growth', 'Crop rotation', 'Crops', 'Data acquisition', 'Efficiency', 'Estimates', 'Fluxes', 'France', 'Gas exchange', 'Growth models', 'Moisture content', 'Performance evaluation', 'Physics', 'Productivity', 'Remote sensing', 'Retention capacity', 'Root-mean-square errors', 'Sensitivity analysis', 'Simulation', 'Soil properties', 'Soil water', 'Soils', 'Sunflowers', 'Water budget', 'Water demand', 'Water resources', 'Water stress', 'Wheat', 'Winter', 'Yield', 'carbon budget', 'crop modeling', 'remote sensing', 'soil properties', 'water budget']",no,no,FR,yes,yes,IACS data only used marginally,Andreas

Climate change is an existential threat to farmers and current patterns of arable agriculture, leading to increases in the variability of agricultural productivity and crop failure. The performance of many of the crops that are currently highly productive will decline significantly and the geographical envelopes within which these crops can be grown are expected to shift northwards in Europe. Farmers will likely be faced with a choice: either leave farming or modify the crops that are grown, adopting new cultivars or species able to be cultivated profitably under future climatic conditions. We hypothesised that farmers do not adopt new crops or cultivars individually but use crops within sequences, called rotations, which are agronomically well understood. We know from past research that changes to rotations will lead to changes in biodiversity and the ecosystem services furnished by farmland, both within a field and at landscape scales. Here, we show how we might: use farmer knowledge of crop agronomy to propose future crop rotations in the light of climate change predictions; model these crop rotations to estimate likely effects on economy, biodiversity and ecosystem services; and validate these predictions through empirical study in regions where the rotations are already used. A workflow of co-development would have the benefit of generating practical rotations built on farmer knowledge and demonstrate empirically the predicted economic and ecological effects, markedly increasing the likely credibility of the results for farmers.

Silvoarable systems are very flexible, and many management practices can be used within them by farmers to sustain crop yields for as long as possible. These include the choice of tree and crop species, tree row orientation, tree row spacing, tree-thinning regimes, tree-pruning intensity, hedging of canopies, soil cultivation methods, and cover cropping. Tree roots do compete with crops, but they can also provide a “safety net” under crops to intercept nutrients and form symbioses with N-fixing or mycorrhizal organisms. Trees share light, water, and nutrients with crops, but competition can be minimized by ensuring increased resource use efficiency of the whole system. Trees increase the water-holding capacity of agricultural soils and contribute to the reduction and management of floodwaters. They influence climate at micro, meso, and macro scales and provide opportunities for climate change mitigation and adaption. At some silvoarable spacings, the arable crops will have to be replaced for the latter part of the tree rotation with pasture. These silvoarable systems then become silvopastoral (or agro-silvi-pastoral) in nature, and they are best suited to areas where mixed farming exists or can be reintroduced.

A realistic estimation of nutrient sources such as surface runoff, tile flow, and groundwater flow is essential in order to be able to predict nutrient loads realistically. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) provides two options for separating surface from subsurface flows, the empirical curve number and the physically based Green and Ampt method. In this study, we evaluated both infiltration models for a small tile-drained agricultural catchment in northeastern Germany using observed data from 2004–2013 and applying the recently introduced Hooghoudt and Kirkham tile drain equations. Model performance statistics indicated that the curve number method performed slightly better than the Green and Ampt method. Nash–Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) for discharge on a daily basis were 0.50 during calibration (0.42 during validation) for the curve number and 0.45 (0.39) for the Green and Ampt method. Tile flow was predicted with NSE values of 0.35 during calibration (0.36 during validation) for the curve number and 0.33 (0.62) for the Green and Ampt method, again on a daily basis. Discharge was mainly divided into tile flow and groundwater flow under both infiltration models. The only important difference with respect to flow components was related to surface runoff with negligible surface runoff using the Green and Ampt method and about 5% surface runoff using the curve number method. Greater tile drain depth and narrower spacing resulted in increased tile flow for both infiltration models, while total discharge remained unaffected by different drainage specifications. We conclude that both infiltration models have their justifications for other SWAT application projects in tile-drained catchments with similar characteristics. Overall, our study revealed that the physically based tile drainage routines which make use of the Hooghoudt and Kirkham tile equations are a promising instrument for modeling tile flow with SWAT.","['Artificial drainage', 'Catchment modeling', 'Infiltration models', 'Soil and Water Assessment Tool', 'Tile flow']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

The proposed architecture is devised to boost the land cover classification task by leveraging two levels of complementarity, i.e., the interplay between radar and optical SITS as well as the synergy between spatial and temporal dependencies.

In a case study model calculations were used to evaluate different options of land use, agricultural and water management to reduce nitrogen immissions and enhance water and nutrient retardation in the Elbe river basin. The model scenarios consider measures which are recommended to reduce nitrogen pollution like organic farming, conversion of arable land into pasture, extensivation of grassland production and set aside. Additionally the re-wetting of formerly drained areas by water management is considered where applicable. Although there are distinct differences in nitrogen leaching between the different agricultural land use and management options, the regional effects of the scenarios on the emissions from the root zone are only fair (max. 13%) because of their limited extent of application. But the targeted application of the measures in zones of high river impact risk derived from groundwater residence times and decay calculations lead to a distinct reduction of the nitrogen input into the river flow system. The combination of water management and extensivation of agricultural production can achieve a reduction of 22% (4.400 t/a) of the nitrogen immissions originated from agriculture.

Temporal and spatial variation of flower resources affects foraging decisions of wild and honey bees. To optimise crop pollination management a better understanding of potential competition for pollinators in mass- and minor-flowering crops is needed. We combined waggle dance decoding, pollen load analysis and field surveys to identify the habitat preferences and pollen use of honey bees in response to spatio-temporal changes in resource availability. Observation hives were placed on the edge of eleven fields of blooming strawberries (mean 2.24 ha) located in landscapes with different amounts of oilseed rape (OSR), semi-natural habitats (SNH) and apple trees in Germany. In addition, we surveyed honey bees and wild bees in strawberry fields. Honey bee dances more often indicated strawberry, OSR fields and SNH than expected given their landscape-wide areas. Honey bees collected on average 7.9 % strawberry, 49.0 % OSR, 30.2 % Pyrus type (e.g. apple) and 12.9 % other pollen types. The mean honey bee foraging distance was 740 m, and decreased with OSR availability. In the observation hives, dances for strawberry fields were not directly affected by OSR availability or SNH land cover. But large amounts of OSR reduced overall honey bee and bumble bee abundance in strawberry fields, while solitary bees were unaffected. Bumble bees were most abundant in strawberry fields (54.1%) and together with solitary bees (19.7%) they represented about 75.0% of the observed bees. Minor-flowering strawberry fields represent a preferred resource for honey bees, especially for small colonies as indicated by decoding of waggle dances. However, the availability of more attractive OSR and local strawberry flower cover moderates the abundance of social bees (honey bees and bumble bees) in strawberry fields while other wild bees were less affected. Hence, we conclude that wild bee conservation plays a major role for strawberry pollination. If pollination services by solitary bees are limited, small honey bee hives can be used scrupulously to supplement pollination services in strawberries.","['Competition', 'Ecosystem service', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Oilseed rape', 'Pollination', 'Strawberriess', 'Waggle dance']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

The Land Parcel Identification System database, which resulted from the European Common Agricultural Policy, is crucial for our method since it provides the spatial and temporal basis of our model (i.e., geographic delineation of islets and information about crop sequences). Local knowledge is used to identify factors determining spatial distribution of cropping systems and to build a generic model that simulates farmers' crop-management strategies.

We asked local experts on quantitative water management to evaluate the ability of the platform to reproduce intra- and inter-annual dynamics at different levels when using our model of the AL as input.

At 5.4 t/ha, the wheat yield was the lowest recorded since 1986 and 30% below the 5-year average. Crop yield forecasting can be considered as near-real-time impact modeling, but unfortunately, none of the forecasting systems in place anticipated the extent of the impact. We summarize key insights and assess the reasons for our failure to forecast French wheat accurately in 2016, with wider implications for quantifying the impacts of extremes on agriculture. The 2015/2016 growing season was characterized by compounding warm autumn temperatures and abnormally wet conditions the following spring. High rainfall and high temperatures leading to fungal diseases, soil water lodging and anoxia, low radiation affecting grain filling, and leaching of nitrogen have all been suggested as important factors ultimately leading to the yield loss. The use of binomial logistic regressions accounting for warm autumn and wet spring conditions together with autumn precipitation and June temperatures, suggests that the odds of an extreme yield loss (i.e., <10th percentile) in 2016 was 35 times higher than expected. The challenge now is further untangling the variety of biotic and abiotic processes interacting at different timescales that can explain observed patterns. Collecting relevant insights from field trial experiments and confronting these with statistical and biophysical crop modeling will be key to achieve this. Besides improving forecasting methodologies, improving the collection, combination, and aggregation of novel real-time data streams will be necessary. Interestingly, a map of yield estimates based on Tweets of farmers harvesting their wheat was the first indication that something was amiss. Such novel data streams can help to anticipate impacts. Improved impact relevant predictors will need to be integrated into operational crop yield forecasting systems in preparation for future compound events.","['Crop yield forecasting', 'Diseases', 'France', 'Fusarium', 'Twitter', 'Wheat']",no,no,FR,yes,yes,no IACS data used,Andreas

In particular, grazed semi-natural grasslands and woody elements support farmland birds, but little is known about their relative effects on bird diversity and community composition. In addition, the relative importance of local habitat versus landscape composition remains unclear. We investigated how the presence of semi-natural grasslands, the number of woody elements and the composition of the wider agricultural landscape affect bird species richness, true diversity (exponential Shannon diversity) and species composition. Bird communities were surveyed four times on 16 paired transects of 250 m each with 8 transects placed between a crop field and a semi-natural grassland and 8 transects between two crop fields with no semi-natural grasslands in the vicinity. The number of woody elements around transects was selected as an important predictor in all models, having a positive effect on species richness and true diversity, while the local presence of semi-natural grasslands was not selected in the best models. However, species richness and true diversity increased with increasing cover of ley and semi-natural grasslands, whereas species composition was modified by the coverage of winter wheat at the landscape scale. Furthermore, bird species richness, true diversity and species composition differed between sampling dates. As bird diversity benefited from woody elements, rather than from the local presence of semi-natural grasslands as such, it is important to maintain woody structures in farmland. However, the positive effect of grassland at the landscape scale highlights the importance of habitat variability at multiple scales. Because species richness and true diversity were affected by different landscape components compared to species composition, a mosaic of land-use types is needed to achieve multiple conservation goals across agricultural landscapes.","['Agri-environment schemes', 'Biodiversity conservation', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Landscape simplification', 'Pastures', 'Tree density']",yes,yes,SE,yes,no,,Andreas

The objective of this paper is to investigate selected agricultural management scenarios on nitrogen loads and to assess the impact of differing catchment characteristics in central Germany. A new modelling approach, which simulates spatially distributed N-transport and transformation processes in soil and groundwater, was applied to three meso scale catchments with strongly deviating climate, soil and topography conditions. The approach uses the integrated modelling framework JAMS to link an agro-ecosystem, a rainfall-runoff and a groundwater nitrogen transport model. Different agricultural management measures with deviating levels of acceptance were analysed in the three study catchments. N-leaching rates in all three catchments varied with soil type, the lowest leaching rates being obtained for loess soil catchment (18.5 kg nitrate N ha−1 yr−1) and the highest for the sandy soils catchment (41.2 kg nitrate N ha−1 yr−1). The simulated baseflow nitrogen concentrations varied between the catchments from 1 to 6 mg N l−1, reflecting the nitrogen reduction capacity of the subsurfaces. The management scenarios showed that the highest N leaching reduction could be achieved by good site-adapted agricultural management options. Nitrogen retention in the subsurface did not alter the ranking of the management scenarios calculated as losses from the soil zone. The reduction effect depended strongly on site specific conditions, especially climate, soil variety and the regional formation of the crop rotations.","['Agriculture', 'Catchment modelling', 'Management', 'Nitrogen', 'Surface water']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

The root of the problem is that farmers are not paid for achieving a desired environmental benefit, but compensated for their costs of management. There is growing interest in formulating result-based economic incentives. By paying for an environmental benefit and allowing flexibility in how to achieve it, farmers are given an incentive to exploit their comparative advantages for achieving a desired environmental benefit cost-effectively. However, the feasibility and relative effectiveness of result-based payments for reducing agricultural pollution is contentious. In this study, we designed and evaluated a result-based payment scheme for nonpoint-source pollution abatement from arable land. In a case study in southern Sweden, the cost-effectiveness of the new scheme was compared with that of an existing action-based scheme for vegetated buffer strips to prevent the pollutant, particulate phosphorus, from reaching water resources. The results suggest that result-based payment schemes based on modeled outcomes of pollution abatement are feasible and will considerably improve cost-effectiveness compared to action-based schemes, by relocating buffer strips to where they are more effective and not simply where they have the lowest costs for farmers.","['Agri-environmental scheme', 'Buffer strip', 'Cost-effective', 'Nonpoint source pollution', 'Nutrient runoff', 'Performance based policy']",no,no,SE,yes,yes,IACS data probably not used,Andreas

This study investigated the arable land (7345 km2) of Saxony (Germany) with regard to the following: (1) the trends of SOC storage and organic matter-related nitrogen fluxes, including their subregional and annual dynamics, (2) changes in the carbon input to arable soils and the turnover of organic matter, and (3) the contribution of different drivers (climate, crop production and fertilization, tillage system) to the simulated SOM changes for the period 1998–2014 on a 500 m grid. The model CANDY carbon balance (CCB) was specifically adapted for large-scale simulations of SOM turnover to link spatial data on soils and climate with regional statistics on agricultural management. This new ‘regional mode’ of CCB has been validated using data from 391 plots across different European locations. The initial SOC levels for Saxony assumed steady state conditions at the beginning of the simulation period and have been validated using data from 667 monitoring sites. The results showed an increase in the SOC stocks of the arable soils of Saxony of 785 × 103 t C (1.24‰ annually) during the simulation period.

In this study, driving factors that influence farmers to change crops on their farm were determined. A questionnaire was administered to four independent groups of farmers who identified and ranked influencing factors pertaining to their choices of crops. The farmers were located in two mid-latitude agricultural watersheds (in Germany and Canada). The ranked influencing factors were used to develop a “farmer driven” scenario to 2040 in both watersheds. Results showed that the most important influencing factors for farmers to change crops were the “economic return of the crop” and “market factors”. Yet, when the drivers of crop land use change were grouped into two categories of “financial” and “indirectly-related financial” factors, the “financial” factors made up approximately half of the influencing factors. For some responses, the “indirectly-related financial” factors (i.e. “access to farm equipment”, the “farm experience”, and “climate”) ranked higher than or just as high as the financial factors. Overall, in the four farmer groups the differences between the rankings of the influencing factors were minor, indicating that drivers may be transferable between farms if the farmers are full-time and the farming regions have comparable growing seasons, access to markets, similar technology, and government programs for farm income. In addition to the “farmer driven” scenario, a “policy driven” scenario was derived for each watershed based only on available information on the financial incentives provided to farmers (i.e. agricultural subsidies, income support, crop insurance). The influencing factors ranked by the farmers provided in-depth information that was not captured by the “policy driven” scenario and contributed to improving predictions for crop land use development. This straight-forward method to rank qualitative data provided by farmers can easily be replicated in other watersheds to improve environmental impact modelling.","['Drivers', 'Farmer decision-making', 'Land use change', 'Modelling', 'Scenario development']",yes,yes,"DE, CA",yes,no,,Andreas

There is compelling evidence that small species are more susceptible than large species. The impact of habitat fragmentation on intraspecific body-size distribution, however, is yet unexplored. Objectives We tested habitat fragmentation, a major driver of pollinator loss, for its impact on intraspecific body-size distributions of solitary wild-bee species. Subsequently, we tested individual body size for its impact on pollination services. Methods We sampled 1272 individuals of the four most common Andrena wild bee species in 22 newly established flowering fields (0.21-0.41 ha) in Hessen, Central Germany, over two consecutive years. Study sites were located in a ca. 80 ha landscape context of increasing habitat fragmentation. We analysed the pollen loads of the most abundant species. Results Body size within local populations of the two medium-sized bees increased with fragmentation, suggesting intraspecific selection for higher dispersal capacity. Pollen analysis carried out for the most common species revealed that larger individuals visited a significantly smaller plant spectrum. Habitat fragmentation may thus alter pollination services without necessarily affecting species richness or composition. Conclusions Systematic body-size variation at the population level thus explains the considerable variability between simple community measures and ecosystem functioning. Filtering processes at the individual level require increased understanding for targeting pollination services under current and future land-use change.","['Bees', 'Community ecology', 'Dispersal', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental filtering', 'Habitat isolation', 'Habitats', 'Inter-tegular distance', 'Land use', 'Phenotypic plasticity', 'Pollen', 'Pollination']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

We find that the percentage of cropland in a given region correlates positively with nitrate concentration in groundwater.

Higher average temperatures result in lower nitrate contamination of groundwater, possibly due to increased evapotranspiration. Higher average precipitation dilutes nitrates in the soil, further reducing groundwater nitrate concentration.

Mechanistic models provide tools to bridge this gap but they are seldom used to study the influence of landscape patterns on biological processes. In this paper, we develop a methodological approach based on sensitivity and multivariate analyses to investigate the relationship between the biological parameters of species and landscape characteristics. As a case study, we used a tritrophic system that includes a host plant (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L.), a pest of the host plant (the pollen beetle, Meligethes aeneus F.), and the main parasitoid of the pest (Tersilochus heterocerus). This tritrophic system was recently represented by a model (Mosaic-Pest) that is spatially explicit at the landscape scale and that includes 32 biological parameters. In the current study, model simulations were compared with observed data from 35 landscapes differing in configuration. Sensitivity analysis using the Morris method identified those biological parameters that were highly sensitive to landscape configuration. Then, multivariate analyses revealed how a parameter's influence on model output could be affected by landscape composition. Comparison of simulated and observed data helped us decrease the uncertainty surrounding the estimated values of the literature-derived parameters describing beetle dispersal and stage transition of the parasitoid at emergence.

The results of the method are compared to prediction based on enrichment ratio (as proposed by Sharpley) and average share of dissolved phosphorus (DP) in total transported phosphorus (5%) that is widely used in the Czech Republic. Four study areas (catchments of dozens of sq. kilometer) were chosen for their different characteristics (land use, average slope, average elevation, phosphorus concentration in the soil) which influence their rainfall-runoff behavior. The modeled results are compared with data measured in situ. The two methods provide similar results in intensively agriculturally used regions. Agreement among the methods was observed for three study areas with significant erosion intensity (above 4 t/ha/year). In the catchment with significantly lower erosion intensity (0.5 t/ha/year), the indirect method (Sharpley) underestimates the amount of DP transported in the watercourses. The sum of transports of suspended solids into watercourses and the average available phosphorus content in the soil determined by the Mehlich 3 method (PM3) are the main factors influencing the results provided by the two methods. An analysis of the impact of these factors on the difference between the results of the methods was provided.

This study aimed at identifying these patterns for a large and representative area in Northern Germany during a six-year period from 2005 to 2010. The analysis was carried out for the entire federal state of Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) which has 1.8 million hectares of arable area.Field data was obtained by the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), which was developed for the administration of the European agricultural direct payments. So far, German IACS has not been exploited in the light of agronomical practice. In total, the available data comprised about 990 000 records for each year, each representing a single field out of the study region. Throughout the analysis, different agronomic and temporal scopes resulted in a different number of fields being accessible for evaluation. Ten major arable crops and crop groups were considered for the study; 184 701 fields representing 645 870 ha of arable area could be analyzed to identify crop sequence patterns over the six years. Thus, 16 836 combinations of the 10 major crops occurring in time and space could be described. Thereof, 12 crop sequence patterns were found covering 55.6% of arable area. For 2010, 619 447 fields representing 1 730 564 ha of arable area, were analyzed with regard to their respective crops and pre-crops. Maize, winter wheat, sugar beet, oilseed rape and potatoes were studied with special emphasis. On average, 46.9% of maize area were cropped following maize as a pre-crop. For winter wheat, self-sequences were identified on 30.0% of arable area. Oilseed rape and sugar beet are generally grown in typical rotations. However, 24.6% of arable crop area were considered as having a pre-crop which might be disadvantageous for crop health.Due to a rapid increase of maize area in the region, crop sequence patterns are undergoing a dramatic shift. It is concluded that a large proportion of arable area is potentially threatened by risks of pest and disease outbreaks as well as by economical over-reliance in a few cash crops.

To study the effect of these AES on a non-target species, the occurrence of the endangered common hamster (Cricetus cricetus) was mapped by counting reopened winter burrows on paired sown wildflower fields and agricultural fields in North-West Bavaria, Germany. Concentration effects in sown wildflower fields and the distribution of C. cricetus in adjacent agricultural fields were studied by mapping burrows up to a distance of 200m from sown wildflower and agricultural fields. Furthermore, C. cricetus occurrence in relation to local (vegetation density, cover of grasses, vegetation height, size of wildflower fields) and landscape scale parameters (percentage of arable land, grassland, fallow land, distance to the nearest forest, and settlement) of sown wildflower fields was analysed. Results show that there was a concentration of C. cricetus in sown wildflower fields, while densities in adjacent agricultural fields were constantly low. Hamster occurrence was negatively related to vegetation density and grass cover on sown wildflower fields and positively related to distance to the nearest forests, percentage of arable land and fallow land around wildflower fields. In conclusion, we could show that sown wildflower fields can be an ideal habitat for non-target species, such as the common hamster.

Correlation and regression analyses revealed the association of biogas plants and livestock density to three variables of agricultural land use, i.e. maize area, expansion of maize area and conversion of permanent grassland to arable land. Negative correlations between biogas plants and maize area were significant for Hesse and three sub-regions (−0.21 to −0.42). However, the positive correlations between livestock density and maize area were higher (0.33–0.66). Biogas plants were considerably negative related to the expansion of maize area on all spatial levels (−0.29 to −0.42). Conversion of grassland was less but still significantly related to biogas plants and livestock density. Biogas plants and livestock density can serve as an indicator for land-use change, especially for permanent grassland and maize area.","['Agricultural land-use change', 'Bioenergy', 'Correlation and multiple linear regression analysi', 'Different spatial scales', 'Livestock density', 'Permanent grassland loss']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

Plant-pollinator networks change according to local and landscape variables, which are important to identify to help conserve pollinators in grasslands. We analysed plant-pollinator networks in 18 grasslands on experimental dairy farms located in three French regions contrasting by their climate, altitude, landscape or management. We combined visual surveys and pollen DNA barcoding. Our objectives were to determine which environmental factors influence pollinator taxa abundance and diversity and differences among the visual plant-pollinator networks in the three farming regions. Flower-visiting insects were trapped in six grasslands per farm during three sessions from mid-April to mid-July along fixed 400 m2 transects. Insects were identified individually to the lowest taxonomic rank possible. Pollen carried by insects was identified using nuclear ribosomal ITS2 sequences belonging to the NCBI nucleotide database. The size and diversity of plant-pollinator networks were much larger and higher in permanent grasslands at the two farms located in lowlands (Mirecourt) and mountains (Marcenat) than those at the farm with temporary grasslands and a crop landscape (Lusignan), but the degree of specialisation (H2′) was relatively similar and low (mean of 0.46). Diptera, especially Empididae and Syrphidae, represented most plant-pollinator interactions in Mirecourt and Marcenat, while Hymenoptera were more abundant at Lusignan. The percentage of semi-natural habitats in 500 m buffers and vegetation height explained 23% of the variance in pollinator abundance. Ranunculus sp. Knautia arvensis, Centaurea jacea and Trifolium repens were key plant species in the networks. DNA metabarcoding of pollen loads identified 114 genera in addition to those identified by visual observations (+34–42 per site), reflecting insects’ floral pathways and differences in the immediate landscape among farms. This study highlighted the importance of Diptera in plant-pollinator networks and the need to conserve permanent grassland diversity to conserve pollinators.","['Agricultural practice', 'DNA bar-coding', 'Diptera', 'Hymenoptera', 'Metagenomics', 'Pollination']",yes,yes,FR,yes,no,,Andreas

In this study, we analyzed the impacts of two spatial targeting options (targeting of erosion-reducing measures on erosion vulnerable areas; targeting of grassland extensification on N-pollution vulnerable areas) on the cost-effectiveness of the single measures and the entire agri-environmental program of the federal state of Brandenburg in Germany. The methodological steps included an analysis of empirical data on land use and program participation, an expert-based environmental impact assessment and a spatial allocation procedure based on linear programming. The environmental impact assessment delivered goal-specific index values for each measures-land parcel combination expressing the suitability of the measures for contributing to four regionally relevant program objectives. The cost-effectiveness of the measures and the program were calculated by putting budgetary costs in relation to the achieved environmental index sum. The calculated cost-effectiveness of the program in 2006 was 89.6% of the simulated optimal cost-effectiveness. The spatial targeting of erosion-reducing measures on erosion vulnerable areas caused an increase in the cost-effectiveness at the measures level and almost no changes at the program level.

Thus, adequate parameterization of soils is one of the most important tasks in physically based catchment modeling. To estimate these properties, the choice of the PTFs in a hydrological model is often made without taking the runoff characteristics of the catchment into consideration. Therefore, this study introduces a methodology to analyze the sensitivity of a catchment water balance model to the choice of the PTF. To do so, we define 11 scenarios including different combinations of PTFs to estimate the van Genuchten parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity. We use a calibrated/validated hydrological model (WaSiM-ETH) as a baseline scenario. By altering the underlying PTFs, the effects on the hydraulic properties are quantified. Moreover, we analyze the resulting changes in the spatial/temporal variation of the total runoff and in particular, the runoff components at the catchment outlet. Results reveal that the water distribution in the hydrologic system varies considerably amongst different PTFs, and the water balance components are highly sensitive to the spatial structure of soil hydraulic properties. It is recommended that models be tested by careful consideration of PTFs and orienting the soil parameterization more towards representing a plausible hydrological behavior rather than focusing on matching the calibration data.","['Calibration', 'Catchment area', 'Catchment models', 'Catchments', 'Components', 'Environmental Studies', 'Grain size', 'Hydraulic properties', 'Hydraulics', 'Hydrologic data', 'Hydrologic models', 'Hydrology', 'Investigations', 'Land use', 'Parameter estimation', 'Parameterization', 'Properties', 'Retention', 'Runoff', 'Sensitivity analysis', 'Soil properties', 'Soil structure', 'Soils', 'Temporal variations', 'Water balance', 'Water distribution', 'Water engineering', 'catchment water balance', 'hydrologic modeling', 'pedotransfer functions', 'runoff components', 'soil hydraulic parameterization', 'spatial pattern comparison', 'water retention curve']",yes,yes,DE,yes,no,,Andreas

This paper focuses on the descriptive analysis of the modifications of this policy change. The analysis of the German Central IACS database (ZID) shows that the current face value and distribution of the payment entitlements largely reflects the historical evolution of German farm structures. While in the old federal states the distribution of payment entitlements differs between regions with intensive and extensive agriculture, the newly-formed states show a more homogenous distribution of the face values. The heterogeneity of payment entitlements is already apparent at the lowest level of spatial aggregation (municipality) in all trade regions. In Germany, the transition to the regional model in 2013 will lead to a substantial redistribution of the agricultural transfer payments of the first pillar. Furthermore, analyses of the ZID shows that trade with payment entitlements per se, that is to say trade without simultaneous trade of land, seldom occurs. The analysis of an expert survey adds up to trading prices of single payments which are markedly lower than the net present value.

However, whether local diversity increases both with decreasing distance from potential source habitats and increasing landscape heterogeneity is poorly known due to a general lack of studies replicated at the landscape scale. We analysed if local assemblages of bumblebees, butterflies and hoverflies in linear uncultivated habitats increased with increasing distance to the nearest semi-natural grassland in 12 replicated landscapes along a gradient of landscape heterogeneity in Scania, Southern Sweden. Species richness and abundance of bumblebees and butterflies, but not hoverflies, decreased with increasing distance to semi-natural grasslands, but none of these groups were related to increasing landscape heterogeneity. Further analyses on trait-specific groups revealed significant decreases in the abundance of sedentary and grassland specialist butterflies with increasing distance to assumed source populations, whereas this was not the case concerning mobile species and grassland generalists. The abundance of all bumblebee trait groups decreased with increasing distance to semi-natural grasslands, but only some species (those nesting above ground, with long colony cycles and with small colony sizes) also increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity. We conclude that local species assemblages of flower-visiting insects in linear habitat elements were mainly affected by the occurrence of nearby semi-natural grasslands.

Models of eight PS that differ, on the one hand, in their regional location (alpine, uplands and lowlands) and, on the other hand, in their production method (conventional versus organic, including traditional and recently emerging pasture-based dairy farming) were designed. In general, the GHGE-reducing effect of a higher milk yield per cow and year in conventional dairy farming cannot compensate for the advantages of organic dairy production which requires lower inputs. This is shown both for GHGE per kg of milk and GHGE per ha and year of farmland. Especially when (imported) concentrates were fed, which had been grown on former forests or grassland, e.g. soybean meal and rapeseed cake, GHGE of conventional dairy farming rose due to the effects of LUC. GHGE per kg milk varied from 0.90 to 1.17 kg CO2-eq for conventional PS, while organic PS on average emitted 11% less greenhouse gases (GHGs), the values ranging from 0.81 to 1.02 CO2-eq per kg milk. Within each production method, PS with a higher milk output generally showed better results for GHGE per kg of milk produced than PS with a lower milk output. Nevertheless the latter showed clearly better results for GHGE per ha of land used, ranging from 5.2 to 7.6 Mg CO2-eq per ha and year for conventional PS and from 4.2 to 6.2 Mg CO2-eq per ha and year for organic PS. The results of this study emphasize the importance of a complete life-cycle assessment in the evaluation of impacts that dairy PS have on the climate.

The total area of agricultural land (cropland and pastures) in Sweden was estimated at 3,496,665 ha and 8.6% of this area (301,489 ha) was classified as agricultural peat and gyttja soils, with 202,383 ha of deep peat, 50,191 ha of shallow peat and 48,915 ha of gyttja soils. Using detailed information on crop distribution from agricultural databases, it was possible to estimate the Cultivation intensity (land use) of the agricultural land. One-quarter of the agricultural area of peat soils was intensively cultivated with annual crops and the remaining area was extensively used, dominated by managed grasslands and pastures. There was great variation in cultivation intensity between areas, from 50% annual crops down to 10%. The gyttja soils were in general more intensively cultivated than the peat soils. The improved estimates of acreage and cultivation intensity of agricultural peat soils were used to calculate annual greenhouse gas emissions from subsidence data. The total carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from Swedish agricultural peat soils in 2003 were estimated to be between 3100 Gg CO(2) and 4600 Gg CO(2), which is similar to or lower than previously reported values. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N(2)O) were estimated at 3.2 Gg N(2)O in 2003.

Consequently, this offers an approach to improving the profiling of farmer types, and strengthens the validity of input into future agricultural policies. While the social survey highlights a certain degree of awareness towards birds with respect to farmer types, the analysis of past farm strategies indicated that farmers did not entirely follow their stated objectives.

In many European countries, arable fields dominate agricultural landscapes. Compared to pastures, arable land is highly variable, resulting in a large spatial variation of food and cover for wildlife over the course of the year, which potentially affects habitat selection by hares. Here, we investigated within‐home‐range habitat selection by hares in arable areas in Denmark and Germany to identify habitat requirements for their conservation. We hypothesized that hare habitat selection would depend on local habitat structure, that is, vegetation height, but also on agricultural field size, vegetation type, and proximity to field edges. Active hares generally selected for short vegetation (1–25 cm) and avoided higher vegetation and bare ground, especially when fields were comparatively larger. Vegetation >50 cm potentially restricts hares from entering parts of their home range and does not provide good forage, the latter also being the case on bare ground. The vegetation type was important for habitat selection by inactive hares, with fabaceae, fallow, and maize being selected for, potentially providing both cover and forage. Our results indicate that patches of shorter vegetation could improve the forage quality and habitat accessibility for hares, especially in areas with large monocultures. Thus, policymakers should aim to increase areas with short vegetation throughout the year. Further, permanent set‐asides, like fallow and wildflower areas, would provide year‐round cover for inactive hares. Finally, the reduction in field sizes would increase the density of field margins, and farming different crop types within small areas could improve the habitat for hares and other farmland species.","['Agricultural land', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agricultural resources', 'Agriculture', 'Animal behavior', 'Arable land', 'Biology', 'Conservation', 'Corn', 'Foraging habitats', 'GPS', 'Habitat improvement', 'Habitat selection', 'Habitats', 'Home range', 'Land conservation', 'Landscape preservation', 'Lepus europaeus', 'Monoculture', 'Pasture', 'Population decline', 'Vegetation', 'Vegetation type', 'Wildlife', 'Wildlife habitats', 'agriculture', 'arable land', 'conservation', 'habitat selection', 'vegetation height']",yes,yes,"DK, DE",yes,no,,

We investigated the effect of these two measures on local species richness, single species occurrence and beta diversity of grassland birds in Poland. We counted birds on AES parcels (with less intensive grassland management) and control parcels, both within and outside Special Protection Areas (SPAs, part of Natura 2000), during 2013–2014. Local species richness of AES-target birds was not associated with AES. Similarly, the turnover of AES-target species among sites was comparable at AES and control parcels. Furthermore, no positive interaction between AES and SPAs was observed, indicating a general lack of effect of AES. Local species richness of SPA-target birds was not higher within than outside SPAs, but two SPA-target species were more common and the beta diversity of SPA-target species was higher within than outside SPAs. Thus, our study showed no positive effects of AES on the occurrence of their target species, but confirmed some positive effects of SPAs on their target species. The decision to restrict AES to Special Protection Areas in 2015–2020 has no justification in our analyses. Actually, many AES-target species will be protected within SPAs irrespective of whether the area is an AES or not, but future AES should also include parcels outside SPAs, as many target species occur there. However, to improve the effectiveness of AES management prescriptions should be diversified and customized to meet the largely different habitat preferences of present target species (such as, for instance, the lapwing and corncrake).","['AES', 'CAP', 'Farmland birds', 'Grazing', 'Mowing', 'Special Protection Areas']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Conservation of species has become relevant even in agricultural areas especially in countries heavily influenced by intensive farming and ubiquitous infrastructure. Based on the UN biodiversity convention all EU membership countries are obliged to develop a high nature value (HNV) farming indicator. The purpose of such an indicator is to provide a basis for informed decisions in prioritizing agricultural subsidies allocating these to high nature value areas. Here, the development of a national HNV farming indicator for Denmark is presented and its application in the Danish government-controlled agricultural subsidy system is outlined. The Danish HNV farming indicator is based on landscape structural parameters, known occurrences of natural and semi-natural habitats, current land use and the distributions of rare and threatened species. It covers all agricultural areas as well as Natura 2000 areas and nationally protected sites in Denmark, ranking them on a 0–13 point scale from low to high nature value according to their estimated value for threatened and rare biodiversity. The Danish government recognizes areas reaching at least 5 points as HNV farming areas eligible to subsidy and from 2015 and onwards the HNV farming indicator will be implemented for allocating part of the agricultural subsidies under the Rural Development Program in Denmark. The indicator will be updated annually to include the growing knowledge of species occurrence and land use changes.","['Agricultural subsidies', 'Biodiversity indicator', 'Conservation', 'Environmental proxies', 'Europe']",?,,DK,,yes,wrong country,

The biological soil-quality index (BSQ) proposed by Parisi et al. (2005) is based on the assumption that higher soil quality is associated with the occurrence of more microarthropod groups that are well-adapted to soil habitats. We used the BSQ concept in the context of a state-wide sustainability assessment on a municipality level. Many soil animals fulfil key ecosystem functions that are the basis for significant and broadly used ecosystem services. These functions and services are essential for any sustainable agriculture type. To determine if and how BSQ values are influenced by land use characteristics, we analysed field data from 243 sampling sites comprising eleven different land cover or land use types. An ordinary least square regression (OLS) was used to assess the influence of land use types, altitude, aspect, slope and geology as independent variables on BSQ values (R2=0.60; p<0.001). In addition to high variability in soil microarthropod communities, there were significant differences in BSQ values among most land use types. BSQ values were highest in forest ecosystems and lowest in arable fields. The parameters of the linear regression model were used together with spatial comprehensive GIS data to predict BSQ values spatially. The predicted values ranged from 0 to 198 and were used to calculate area-weighted mean BSQ values for all municipalities in South Tyrol. Our results show that the BSQ reacts sensitively to land use and hence can serve as an important surrogate indicator for sustainable land use practices.","['Arthropod', 'Geographic information system', 'Land use', 'Soil health', 'Spatial modelling', 'Sustainability']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Analysing the effects of land-use changes on ES can contribute to an improved understanding of the interactions between socio-economic development, landscape changes and ES, which is fundamental in order to avoid or mitigate the undesired consequences of today's decisions. Studies at longer timescales are still underrepresented, but are also fundamental for capturing slow social and ecological processes. This study therefore analysed the impacts of land-use/land cover (LULC) changes on ES values from the past to the future (1860–2100) in the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol (Italy). Future scenarios were based on socio-economic storylines and their spatial distribution mapped. By attributing ES values to LULC types, we assessed changes in ES values as well as their spatial patterns. Our results indicate that the abandonment of mountain grassland induced an ongoing shift in ES at higher elevations, from grassland-related ES towards forest-related ES. The intensification of use in the valley bottoms had predominantly negative effects on regulation & maintenance, and cultural ES in the past. Under future scenarios, changes in ES values at lower elevations greatly depend on expected socio-economic development. Negative effects on regulation & maintenance and cultural ES were highest for the ‘Food sovereignty’ scenario due to huge transformations of grassland and permanent cultures to arable land in order to optimise food provision at the regional level. In contrast, under the ‘Liberalisation’ and ‘Rewilding’ scenarios, there were positive trends for forest-related provisioning ES and less negative effects on regulation & maintenance and cultural ES within the study area, but the dependence on imported products increased. Our findings provide valuable information for decision-making and policy development in order to minimise negative consequences through targeted management measures or payments for environmental services.","['Adaptation', 'Ecosystem service mapping', 'Mountain region', 'Policy-making', 'Scenario analysis', 'Sustainability']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Detailed crop type maps during the period of 2000–2009 were used to derive time series of crop-specific GAI by selecting only the 250-m MODIS pixels that have at least 75% purity of the target crop. Two important model parameters were optimised by minimising the difference between the simulated and observed GAI for each individual pixel and year. The resulting year-specific joint parameter distributions were then used to run an ensemble of crop simulations in which the ensemble was initialised by sampling from the joint distribution of the corresponding year. The semi-variograms of the retrieved parameters revealed that the spatial patterns were consistent with agricultural practices and that seasonal characteristics of weather patterns in Wallonia can explain – at least partially – the temporal variability observed in the retrieved parameter distributions. Finally, the results of the average ensemble crop simulation were aggregated to the provincial and regional levels. A validation using yields reported by EUROSTAT over the period 2000–2009 revealed that assimilating MODIS with GAI provides an improved relationship between simulation results and reported yields at the regional level.","['Data assimilation', 'Green area index (GAI)', 'MODIS', 'Regional scale', 'WOFOST', 'Winter wheat']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Farmers' rationale for participation in agri-environment measures with different implementation complexity,2013,Journal of Environmental Management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.09.030,"European agri-environment programmes are based on the common principle that farmers deliver environmental services for which society pays. Due to the voluntary nature of agri-environment measures (AEM), the issue of farmers' motives or reasons for participation has been an important topic of investigation in past years. The present paper examines farmers' rationale for participation in AEM against the backdrop of continued debate over whether to develop relatively simple measures that can be readily applied by many farmers or give greater priority to measures that are more targeted – i.e. to the specific management requirement of particular habitats or species – but are often more complex. The paper draws on empirical material from a case study in the Dyle valley, Belgium, including in-depth interviews, expert consultations and a mail survey. It was sought not only to identify and quantify the importance of separate reasons for participation, but also to reveal how these reasons and other elements of relevance were logically interrelated in the explanation that farmers themselves give for their participation. As a result, six modes or styles of participation were identified: opportunistic, calculative, compensatory, optimising, catalysing and engaged. The analyses suggest that there were notable differences in that both separate reasons for and modes of participation do vary with the complexity of the measures' requirements. Overall, the study demonstrates that participation in AEM is not simply a matter of weighing the money against the effort for adoption. Whereas money is an important driver for participation (in particular, for those adopting complex AEM) it plays widely differing roles depending on the level of farmers' reasoning (farm enterprise, single practice or landscape feature) and the importance they give to other considerations (environmental effect, production potential of land, goodness of fit, etc.). Practical implications are drawn for both policy makers and programme managers who develop and make available tailor-made support.","['Agri-environmental management', 'Biodiversity', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Farmer motivations', 'Logical analysis', 'Participation styles']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Studies on cultural ecosystem services, however, remain rare and little is known about the spatial localisation of these services. In this study, we adopt and test a framework to identify and map the provision of cultural ecosystem services as perceived by tourists in an Alpine region, i.e. the region of South Tyrol in Italy. A photo-based questionnaire survey is combined with cartographical representations of landscape types to elicit hot and coldspot areas of cultural ecosystem service provision. We statistically test for influences of the land use type and the respondents' socio-demographic background on the tourists' perception of these services. The results show that different spatial patterns emerge for each of the investigated cultural ecosystem services depending on the distribution and extent of the landscape types to which they are related. In particular traditionally managed landscapes, small in extent and mainly scattered over large areas between 1000 and 2200m a.s.l., are hotspot areas of aesthetic beauty, leisure activities and spirituality. In contrast, intensively managed landscapes, mainly located in the lowland plains of the study site, are considered to be more important for the provision of cultural heritage values. While the results suggest that land use type exerts the strongest influence upon tourists' perception, factors such as the respondents' perceived importance of the services, their gender, cultural background, environmental engagement and experience with the landscape play a significant but subordinate role. We conclude that the spatially explicit information about the provision of cultural ecosystem services can serve as a helpful basis for the design and further implementation of land use policies that acknowledge the high touristic value of traditionally used landscapes in mountain regions.","['Cultural ecosystem service', 'Ecosystem service mapping', 'Ecosystem service potential', 'Land use change', 'Landscape perception', 'Traditional landscape']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

First, based on fine scale data, indicators derived from the High Nature Value farmland concept are tested at different scales, resolutions and situations: LAU2 for The Netherlands and LAU1 for France. The effect of rural development measures on the evolution of these indicators is then explored. Significant cause-effect relationships are found in the French cases, while only relationships of correlations are observed from the Dutch case study, obviously caused by a lack of data. Using fine scale data on rural development measures related to both 2000–2006 and 2007–2013 programming periods of the Common Agricultural Policy, a spatial econometrics methodology is applied to France, at national level on the one hand, and at a selected NUTS2 level on the other. The results indicate that agri-environmental schemes and specific rural development measures affect the changes in the indicators, and that the spatial scale of the analyses matters. In particular, results indicate that trends observed at the national scale do not necessarily apply at the regional scale (e.g. impacts of conversion to organic farming, the grassland premium, payments for water and biodiversity protection) underlining the importance of multi-scale assessments. Interestingly, delayed effects of the measures implemented in the 2000–2006 programming period, such as machinery investment aids and less-favoured area payments, are detectable. As regards the 2007–2013 rural development measures, the most significant positive effects on the farm nature value indicator are found, at the national level, for locally targeted agri-environmental schemes focused on biodiversity and water issues and, at the NUTS2 level, for supporting organic farming schemes. Given that the farm nature value indicator is built from three different indices (addressing crop diversity, grassland share, and wooded and afforested farmland) the effect of rural development measures on each of these individual indices is also explored. This enables the main structure and the magnitude of policy impacts to be captured and helps with the understanding of why certain objectives were not met. Key findings are relevant in the context of policy monitoring and evaluation, while the methodology proposed, that incorporates spatial effects, is an important contribution to the implementation of the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework by Member States to account for national, regional or local characteristics.","['Common Agricultural Policy', 'Environmental indicators', 'High Nature Value', 'Impact evaluation', 'Rural development', 'Spatial econometrics']",yes,yes,"NL, FR",yes,no,,

The scope of these two case studies is to understand if and how conservation of local agro-biodiversity is enhanced by AFNs and, if this is the case, what are the causes for AFNs having positive impacts on agro-biodiversity conservation.

General-purpose land cover maps (CORINE and PELCOM) are compared to raster maps generated from the detailed parcel data. Both the CORINE and PELCOM strongly overestimate arable land use in the study area, and neither is able to correctly represent minor land use classes. The farm location–land use relationship as well as land use quantities and other spatial metrics are found to be sensitive to the format, source and resolution of the spatial data for the study area.

In Europe, soil erosion by water and tillage is responsible for the loss of fertile topsoil and therefore productive land. Under Global Change scenarios climate and land use are expected to impact soil loss and sediment discharge rates distinctly in contrasting climatic regions, further influenced by tillage practices. Soil erosion modeling is a valuable tool to estimate future changes and elucidate opportunities to mitigate future threats to soil loss and crop yield, ultimately leading to the development of Best Management Practices (BMPs). In this study, future change of soil erosion processes under the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6 and RCP6.0, as well as a conventional tillage (CT) and a reduced tillage (RT) practice are investigated in two small agricultural catchments in Europe under contrasting climate; Can Revull in Spain and Fugnitz in Austria. We applied GeoWEPP, the Geospatial Interface for the Water Erosion Prediction Project, to model these two agricultural catchments at a fine spatial resolution. We demonstrate that tillage practice, precipitation and runoff are driving factors for soil erosion at both locations. Furthermore, we illustrate that tillage practices have a greater effect on soil erosion than climate change scenarios. RT could reduce soil erosion by more than 75% compared to CT practices. Under RCP6.0, future changes in runoff, hillslope soil loss and sediment discharge would be greater compared to RCP2.6, with different responses depending on the investigated climatic region. Linking soil erosion models on a fine spatial scale and with different management practices to downscaled global circulation models, can provide valuable input for the development of future BMPs to reduce soil loss in agricultural landscapes.","['GeoWEPP', 'Global change', 'Sediment discharge', 'Soil erosion modeling', 'Soil loss']",no,no,"AT, ES",yes,yes,no IACS,

Vineyards are characterised by non-productive inter-rows, which could potentially host diverse plant communities. Mulching, tillage or herbicides are used to mitigate the competition between vines and the inter-row vegetation. As plant species with the same set of functional traits will respond similarly to environmental filters like management measures, knowledge about plant trait–environment-relations can be used to predict community and ecosystem processes which are essential for preserving ecosystem services like soil erosion mitigation. We hypothesized that higher vegetation management intensity reduces plant (functional) diversity, changes functional traits and community composition. Across Europe, four viticultural regions in Austria, France, Spain and Romania, which comprised 78 vineyards differing in vegetation management intensity (bare soil, temporary and permanent vegetation cover), were selected for sampling vascular plant diversity. Around each vineyard, the surrounding landscape composition and landscape diversity was investigated within a 750m radius. Rao's quadratic entropy as a measure of functional diversity was calculated based on a selection of plant functional traits. The effects of management and landscape variables on species richness, functional traits, functional diversity and vegetation cover were analysed by generalized linear mixed models and random forests (RF). Furthermore, plant community composition was analysed with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Higher management intensities resulted in lower species richness, functional diversity and vegetation cover. The country with the related divergent edaphoclimatic conditions was a significant factor affecting most diversity and functional trait parameters, whereas landscape diversity increased plant species richness only slightly. Vegetation management intensity had the highest explanatory power for species richness, functional diversity and most functional traits according to RF analysis. Consequently, plant functional traits like a higher coverage of ruderals and annuals could be clearly related to bare soil management. Furthermore, the type of cover crops influenced the relationship between annual and perennial plant species, Grime plant strategy types and species diversity. Accordingly, NMDS showed a separation between permanent vegetation cover and bare soil vineyards. The overall positive effect of extensive management and the use of diverse cover crops or spontaneous vegetation in vineyard inter-rows should be better implemented in agricultural policies to support both, biodiversity and ecosystem provision.","['Agroecology', 'Cover crops', 'Ecosystem services', 'Herbicides', 'Landscape', 'Tillage']",yes,yes,"AT, FR, ES, RO",yes,no,,

Over the last 50 years, many technological innovations and political changes have transformed agriculture in Europe, resulting in substantial decrease of farmland area in many parts of the continent that potentially signify a shift in European land use systems. However, the relative importance of technological advances and agricultural policy to these changes is not well understood, and our goal here was to disentangle them. Because of its unique political context, Spain offers an ideal laboratory to investigate the impacts of technological and political innovations to regime change in land systems. During the time when agricultural innovation was at its peak (1960–1980) Spain was not part of the European Economic Community (EEC). The Spanish agricultural sector then experienced a shock after joining the EEC in 1986. Using historical aerial photographs, land use maps, and Farm Structure Surveys as our reference data, we compared changes in land cover in Terra Chá, a district of Northwest Spain from 1956–1984 and 1984–2005, i.e., approximately before and after the EEC accession in 1986, using spatially explicit multinomial logit models to quantify the relative impacts of technological innovation and political change on agriculture and forest lands. In our study area much more substantial shifts in agricultural and forest land took place after EEC accession than before. The dominant shift was a substantial increase in forest cover (from 7% to 31% of the landscape) and concurrent loss of agriculture (from 45% to 38%) and shrubland (from 46% to 27%).

We studied the survival and spatial behaviour of 12 wild Iberian hares translocated in Northwestern Spain, in a hunting ground with a combination of arable land, vineyards and other habitats where game management and hare coursing were conducted. The average hare survival time was 102&#xa0;days, with adults showing higher survival than juveniles, the overall survival probability being reduced during the hunting season. Presumed predation was the most important cause of death (ranging 45–77% of causalities), and 23% of hares were hunted. Hares showed a higher resting place selection at daytime for arable land, selecting however to settle in areas with a combination of habitats. The average core area considering all animals (MCP 50%) was 7.4&#xa0;ha and the home range (MCP 95%) was 27&#xa0;ha, and males showed significant higher values of home range compared to females. When compared to previous studies on wild hares, the survival of translocated hares in the present study was in general lower but there were similarities on spatial behaviour, and hunting was considered a major factor driving survival and spatial behaviour.","['Agricultural land', 'Animal Welfare', 'Arable land', 'Game management', 'Habitat selection', 'Home range', 'Hunting', 'Leporidae', 'Lepus granatensis', 'Predation', 'Spain', 'Survival', 'Translocation', 'Vineyards', 'Wildlife conservation']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

However, who are the land managers? What are their practices? Our research on the traditional olive groves of the Monte Pisano (Tuscany, Italy) reveals for the first time the quantitatively important role of hobby farmers as land managers in the area. We used a three-step-method: first, a database was constructed using several data sources to identify and map the population of olive growers; then, 35 semi-structured interviews were conducted, and finally, the data were analyzed to highlight the contribution of olive growers to the land management, along with their motivations and constraints. Our results found that hobby farmers constitute about 90% of all land managers in the study area and manage more than half of the agricultural land. They are a very uneven group, and there are no clear categories detectable by analyzing sociodemographic factors, practices and farm characteristics. They are the “same but different”, not following any market rules, as they are not profit-oriented. Their farming practices are quite homogeneous and mainly in-line with professional farming practices of that area, oriented versus a minimum input management.","['Abandonment', 'Agricultural land', 'Agricultural practices', 'Agriculture', 'Case studies', 'Conservation', 'Farm management', 'Farmers', 'Farming', 'Italy', 'Land management', 'Land use', 'Lifestyles', 'Rural areas', 'Urban areas', 'farming practices', 'hobby farming', 'olive groves', 'peri-urban', 'stewardship']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

A tighter integration of cropping and livestock systems, both in terms of feed and manure flows, can be beneficial for the farm economy and the environment. The greening of the direct payments, which was introduced in the European Union’s greening reform in 2013, is assumed to stimulate the transition towards more sustainable systems. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the impacts of greening policies on important economic and environmental indicators of sustainability, and explore potential further improvements in policies. The Farm System SIMulator (FSSIM) bioeconomic farm model was used to simulate the consequences of scenarios of policy change on three representative dairy farms in Piedmont, Italy, i.e., an ‘intensive’, an ‘extensive’, and an ‘organic’ dairy farm. Results showed that in general, there is a large potential to increase the current economic performance of all of the farms. The most profitable activity is milk production, resulting in the allocation of all of the available farm land to feed production. Imposing feed self-sufficiency targets results in a larger adaptation of current managerial practice than the adaptations that are required due to the greening policy scenario. It was shown that the cropping system is not always able to sustain the actual herd composition when 90% feed self-sufficiency is imposed. Regarding the greening policies, it is shown that extensive and organic farms already largely comply with the greening constrains, and the extra subsidy is therefore a bonus, while the intensive farm is likely to sacrifice the subsidy, as adapting the farm plan will substantially reduce profit. The introduction of nitrogen (N)-fixing crops in ecological focus areas was the easiest greening strategy to adopt, and led to an increase in the protein feed self-sufficiency. In conclusion, it is important to note that the greening policy in its current form does not lead to reduced environmental impacts. This implies that in order to improve environmental performance, regulations are needed rather than voluntary economic incentives.","['Adaptations', 'Agricultural land', 'Agricultural production', 'Agriculture', 'Air pollution', 'Cereals', 'Climate change', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Corn', 'Cropping systems', 'Crops', 'Dairy farming', 'Dairy farms', 'Economic incentives', 'Economics', 'Efficiency', 'Environmental economics', 'Environmental impact', 'Environmental indicators', 'Environmental management', 'Environmental policy', 'Farms', 'Feeds', 'Grasslands', 'Greening', 'Incentives', 'Italy', 'Livestock', 'Milk', 'Milk production', 'Nitrogen', 'Organic farming', 'Policies', 'Self sufficiency', 'Sustainability', 'Sustainable agriculture', 'Sustainable development', 'Technological change', 'Wheat', 'agro-environmental indicators', 'bioeconomic modelling', 'common agricultural policy', 'dairy farming', 'feed self-sufficiency', 'greening policy']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Making sense of Sentinel observations requires high quality and timely in-situ data for training and validation. Classical ground truth collection is expensive, lacks scale, fails to exploit opportunities for automation, and is prone to sampling error. Here we evaluate the potential contribution of opportunistically exploiting crowdsourced street-level imagery to collect massive high-quality in-situ data in the context of crop monitoring. This study assesses this potential by answering two questions: (1) what is the spatial availability of these images across the European Union (EU), and (2) can these images be transformed to useful data? To answer the first question, we evaluated the EU availability of street-level images on Mapillary—the largest open-access platform for such images—against the Land Use and land Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018, a systematic surveyed sampling of 337,031 points. For 37.78% of the LUCAS points a crowdsourced image is available within a 2 km buffer, with a mean distance of 816.11 m. We estimate that 9.44% of the EU territory has a crowdsourced image within 300 m from a LUCAS point, illustrating the huge potential of crowdsourcing as a complementary sampling tool. After artificial and built up (63.14%), and inland water (43.67%) land cover classes, arable land has the highest availability at 40.78%. To answer the second question, we focus on identifying crops at parcel level using all 13.6 million Mapillary images collected in the Netherlands. Only 1.9% of the contributors generated 75.15% of the images. A procedure was developed to select and harvest the pictures potentially best suited to identify crops using the geometries of 785,710 Dutch parcels and the pictures’ meta-data such as camera orientation and focal length. Availability of crowdsourced imagery looking at parcels was assessed for eight different crop groups with the 2017 parcel level declarations. Parcel revisits during the growing season allowed to track crop growth. Examples illustrate the capacity to recognize crops and their phenological development on crowdsourced street-level imagery. Consecutive images taken during the same capture track allow selecting the image with the best unobstructed view. In the future, dedicated crop capture tasks can improve image quality and expand coverage in rural areas.","['Agricultural land', 'Arable land', 'Automation', 'Availability', 'Common Agricultural Policy', 'Conservation', 'Copernicus', 'Crop growth', 'Crop identification', 'Crops', 'Crowdsourcing', 'Data collection', 'Evaluation', 'Global positioning systems--GPS', 'Ground truth', 'Growing season', 'Image quality', 'Inland waters', 'LUCAS', 'Land cover', 'Land use', 'Monitoring', 'Netherlands', 'Phenology', 'Photographs', 'Pictures', 'Questions', 'Remote sensing', 'Rural areas', 'Sampling', 'Satellite observation', 'Smartphones', 'United States--US', 'agriculture', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'in-situ', 'street-view']",no,no,,,yes,no use of IACS,

Overall, habitat structure and seasonality were more important in explaining hare habitat selection and home range size compared to direct weather conditions. Nevertheless, hares adjusted habitat selection and daily home range size in response to temperature, wind speed and humidity, possibly in response to thermal constrains and predation risk.ConclusionsFor effective conservation, habitat heterogeneity should be increased, e.g. by reducing agricultural field sizes and the implementation of set-asides that provide both forage and shelter, especially during the colder months of the year.","['Agricultural land', 'Animal behavior', 'Climate effects', 'Environmental Studies', 'European hare', 'Food availability', 'Food security', 'Foraging habitats', 'GPS', 'Global positioning systems--GPS', 'Habitat changes', 'Habitat selection', 'Habitats', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home range', 'Land use', 'Lepus europaeus', 'Predation', 'Satellite navigation systems', 'Seasonal variations', 'Shelters', 'Weather', 'Wind speed']",yes,yes,"DK, DE",yes,no,,

SNG is related to, and influenced by, agricultural land use. Both intensive land use as well as a lack of extensive land use can reduce the extent and quality of SNG. For Denmark, this paper demonstrates how parcel-specific land-use data can be applied to detect localities with spatial convergences and conflicts between SNG and agricultural land use. Based on their respective influence on SNG, land use is aggregated into five major classes and spatially overlaid with existing nationally registered SNG. Results show that almost 11 % of all SNG is mapped either on cropped land or on rotational grassland, indicating a conflict between mapped SNG and land use. Thirty percent of SNG is mapped outside any agricultural land use, pointing to a lack of management. Fifty nine percent of SNG is mapped either on land receiving payments for grazing/mowing or on other land under extensive management, indicating a convergence between SNG and land use. Finally, 30 % of land receiving payments for grazing/mowing and 62 % of other land under extensive management does not contain any semi-natural habitat. Potential, as yet unmapped, SNG might exist in these localities. Based on these results it is argued that the application of parcel-specific land-use data could significantly improve monitoring of SNG.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","['22131:Water Supply and Irrigation Systems', '8400:Agriculture industry', '9130:Experimental/theoretical', '9175:Western Europe', 'Agriculture', 'Agriculture -- statistics & numerical data', 'Conservation of Natural Resources -- methods', 'Denmark', 'Ecosystem', 'Environmental Monitoring -- methods', 'Environmental Studies', 'Environmental monitoring', 'Europe', 'Grasslands', 'Habitats', 'Land use', 'Land use planning', 'Regions', 'Registration', 'Studies', 'Vegetation']",?,,,,yes,wrong country,

Considering the operational aspect of the CAP monitoring process, the use of Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images is highly relevant, especially in regions with a frequent cloud cover, such as Belgium. Indeed, SAR imagery does not depend on sunlight and is barely affected by the presence of clouds. Moreover, the SAR signal is particularly sensitive to the geometry and the water content of the target. Crop identification is often a pre-requisite to monitor agriculture at parcel level (ploughing, harvest, grassland mowing, intercropping, etc.) The main goal of this study is to assess the performances and constraints of a SAR-based crop classification in an operational large-scale application. The Random Forest object-oriented classification model is built on Sentinel-1 time series from January to August 2020 only. It can identify crops in the Walloon Region (south part of Belgium) with high performance: 93.4% of well-classified area, representing 88.4% of the parcels. Among the 48 crop groups, the six most represented ones get a F1-score higher or equal to 84%. Additionally, this research documents how the classification performance is affected by different parameters: the SAR orbit, the size of the training dataset, the use of different internal buffers on parcel polygons before signal extraction, the set of explanatory variables, and the period of the time series. In an operational context, this allows to choose the right balance between classification accuracy and model complexity. A key result is that using a training dataset containing only 3.2% of the total number of parcels allows to correctly classify 91.7% of the agricultural area. The impact of rain and snow is also discussed. Finally, this research analyses how the classification accuracy depends on some characteristics of the parcels like their shape or size. This allows to assess the relevance of the classification depending on those characteristics, as well as to identify a subset of parcels for which the global accuracy is higher.

Following both precision and usability criteria, two main C sink databases covering the Andalusian region (S Spain) were developed from the Spanish Land Parcel Identification System (SIGPAC, coarse resolution) and the Spanish Information System on Land Cover (SIOSE, finer resolution) land use classes. Particular C sink factors based on growth rates for individual plant species were associated with detailed vegetation maps and, further, were linked to Land Use and Covers cartography across the region. In addition, eight ruminant farms were exhaustively studied in situ and used as a control. Results were compared with the obtained through the application of the developed C sink databases, and with the commonly used Petersen methodology. The sink capacity of vegetation associated with farms varied from 0.25 to 1.37 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), depending on the plant species composition and abundance. All the approaches showed significant differences from the control. C sink values were significantly higher when applying SIGPAC-based C sink database to farms, while values from the SIOSE and Petersen methodology approaches provided more moderate values, closer to the control. SIGPAC and Petersen approaches showed higher usability but presented lower precision due to a poor definition of plant cover. SIOSE-based C sink database provided suitable values able to be adapted to reality and used by farmers. In this regard, further research efforts to improve the adjustment of results and ease of use are required. The present approach means a methodological advance in the estimation of the C sink capacity associated with pastoral livestock farms, able to be incorporated into the CF calculation in contrasted areas worldwide, in the frame of the 'eco-schemes' being recently under development through the EU CAP.

For instance, in Wallonia (Belgium), as a result of the provisions of the Government Decree on agri-environmental measures, farmers are increasingly encouraged to adopt environmentally friendly practices such as the creation of grassy headlands in their fields. As European agriculture is changing, tools are needed to monitor the evolution of agricultural practices, to control policy application and to advise farmers. In this framework, we present a new approach to optimise the establishment of grassy headlands in cultivated fields. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), we identify exact locations where farmers can introduce grassy headlands in accordance with legal specifications and environmental concerns and calculate the total length of grassy headland that farmers can establish considering the features of their farm and parcels and for which they can receive subsidies. It indicates a potential, which could serve as a calculation baseline for an indicator. Wallonia was chosen as study area because a digitised parcel plan has been available from the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) since 1997. The methodological approach proposes a new valorisation of this spatial information layer and can be considered as an example of application providing relevant information for several intervention levels: national or regional decisionmakers, advisors and individual farmers. Since all EU Member States had to set up their own GIS-based land parcel system starting in 2005, our approach may be useful as is or in similar applications in other countries.
