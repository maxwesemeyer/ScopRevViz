We propose a general framework for the analysis of the conjunctive implementation of both land management options. This general framework provides an empirical rule of selection that can easily be implemented by a land-planner without specific knowledge of optimization procedures. Our main finding is that both the environmental benefit to cost ratio and the benefit difference (between a sharing and a sparing management option) to cost difference ratio matter for selection of parcels. We then develop an empirical application of this framework for the Seine-Ource river catchment in Burgundy, France. We look for the best land management option to implement for water quality preservation.

In this study, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated for mainland France from multispectral imagery. For 67% and 84% of the area under spring-sown crops for years 2018 and 2019, soil cover during the previous winter was estimated through the computation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using Sentinel-2 multispectral images. At country scale, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated between 37% and 48% for 2018 and between 31% and 43% for 2019, depending on the NDVI threshold for a soil to be considered covered by at least 50% of vegetation. Spatial patterns were relatively similar between the two years studied, highlighting strong heterogeneities between French departments. Cropping systems may explain some of these heterogeneities, as it has been shown that there is a large variability in the soil cover rate between spring-sown crops, but also depending on the previous crop. Winter soil cover rate was higher for crops associated with livestock production, such as maize silage (between 59% and 74% of plots covered before this crop). It was also shown that winter soil cover could be ensured by other means than cover crops: temporary grasslands were the previous crop with the highest soil cover, probably due to late ploughing.

We examine the semi-arid Seewinkel region in Austria and explore interactions between climatic, agronomic, hydrological, and socio-economic conditions and processes to provide policy advice. The assessment is conducted with a spatially explicit integrated modeling framework to analyze impacts on land and irrigation water use, land management, and net benefits of agricultural production. The model results show that with imposed groundwater restrictions for irrigation, land use shifts from irrigated vineyards to mostly rainfed cropland with declining regional net benefits of agricultural production. The direction of change is similar for a DRY, SIMILAR, and WET climate scenario, while the magnitude differs. We estimate that an increase of the marginal value of groundwater extraction for irrigation by 0.1 €/m3 results in an average decrease in groundwater extraction volumes by 17.2 Mm3 in DRY, 6.3 Mm3 in SIMILAR, and 6.4 Mm3 in WET.

In this context, the objective of this study is to evaluate the contribution of multispectral satellite imagery (optical and radar) to land use and land cover classification. Object-oriented supervised classifications, based on a Random Forest algorithm, and majority zoning post-processing are used. This study emerges from the experiment on multi-sensor crop monitoring (MCM'10, Baup et al., 2012) conducted in 2010 on a mixed farming area in the southwest of France, near Toulouse. This experiment enabled the regular and quasi-synchronous collection of multi-sensor satellite data and in situ observations, which are used in this study. 211 plots with contrasting characteristics (different slopes, soil types, aspects, farming practices, shapes and surface areas) were monitored to represent the variability of the study area. They can be grouped into four classes of land cover: 39 grassland areas, 100 plots of wheat, 13 plots of barley, 20 plots of rapeseed, and 2 classes of bare soil: 23 plots of small roughness and 16 plots of medium roughness. Satellite radar images in the X-, C- and L-bands (HH polarization) were acquired between 14 and 18 April 2010. Optical images delivered by Formosat-2 and corresponding field data were acquired on 14 April 2010. The results show that combining images acquired in the L-band (Alos) and the optical range (Formosat-2) improves the classification performance (overall accuracy?=?0.85, kappa?=?0.81) compared to the use of radar or optical data alone. The results obtained for the various types of land cover show performance levels and confusions related to the phenological stage of the species studied, with the geometry of the cover, the roughness states of the surfaces, etc. Performance is also related to the wavelength and penetration depth of the signal providing the images.

In view of the global climate change, detecting its change is growing in importance from both an environmental and a socio-economic point of view. A well-recognised tool for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection (CD), including grassland changes, is Remote Sensing (RS). An important aspect affecting the accuracy of change detection is finding the optimal indicators of LULC changes (i.e., variables). Inappropriately selected variables can produce inaccurate results burdened with a number of uncertainties. The aim of our study is to find the most suitable variables for the detection of grassland to cropland change, based on a pair of high resolution images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite and from the vector database Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). In total, 59 variables were used to create models using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), the quality of which was verified through multi-temporal object-based change detection. Satisfactory accuracy for the detection of grassland to cropland change was achieved using all of the statistically identified models. However, a three-variable model can be recommended for practical use, namely by combining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wetness and Fifth components of Tasselled Cap. Increasing number of variables did not significantly improve the accuracy of detection, but rather complicated the interpretation of the results and was less accurate than detection based on the original Landsat 8 images. The results obtained using these three variables are applicable in landscape management, agriculture, subsidy policy, or in updating existing LULC databases. Further research implementing these variables in combination with spatial data obtained by other RS techniques is needed.

A systematic analysis of potential impacts related to multi-seasonal dry spells, effective adaptation measures, and the economic value of climate information (VoI) may inform decision-making and facilitate the uptake and use of climate information. Hence, we have developed an integrated modeling framework consisting of a statistical climate model, a crop rotation model, a bio-physical process model, a portfolio optimization model, the computation of the economic value of climate information, and a spatial hot spot analysis and applied it to the context of water stress management in crop production in Austria. Results from the integrated modeling framework show that the average economic value of climate information ranges between 13 and 99 €/ha for Austrian cropland, depending on the scenario of multi-seasonal dry spells and the farmers’ risk aversion level. On average, the value of climate information is highest on flat and productive soils, for root and oil crops, under more extreme multi-seasonal dry spells, and if farmers are highly risk averse.

While such meadows are typical habitats for temperate Europe, they experienced a decline in their total area during the second half of the 20th century, both in Western and Eastern Europe. In this contribution, we compare their current area and status in terms of semantics, law, public support in general, and the efficiency of public support in both Saxony and the Czech Republic. We estimated the area in Saxony on the basis of three public mapping projects. In the Czech Republic, where no recent mapping included orchard meadows as a specific land-use type, we carried out our own mapping. Hence, we mapped 124 randomly selected plots of 1 km2. To cross-reference results from both countries, we used the pan-EU project LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey). According to various different sources, the orchard meadows cover 0.09–0.55% of Saxony and 0.01–0.72% of the Czech Republic. Interestingly, the results of the three mapping projects conducted in Saxony vary from each other. Although orchard meadows are supported by financial incentives of the respective governments in both countries, the Saxon approach concentrating more on individual activities (sanitation of old trees, planting, grassland management), seems more focused than the single measure practised in the Czech Republic. One key to a greater public awareness of the orchard meadow problematic can lie in the promotion of a simple expression referring to this specific landscape feature in Czech, similar to the phrase common in the German language: ‘Streuobstwiese’.

We evaluated effects on reproductive success of field bean (Vicia faba) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using data from two study systems, both including study sites (1?km radius) with (flower strip sites) or without flower strips (control sites). To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders (>?160?m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site (>?160?m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes.

In this study, we related eight ES potentials to the species richness of five invertebrate, vertebrate and plant taxonomic groups in cereal farming systems. The landscape complexity gradient ranged from areas dominated by annually tilled arable land to areas with high proportions of unfertilized, non-rotational pastures and uncultivated field borders.

Here, we modelled population sizes of five farmland birds in central Germany as the German Sustainability Indicator for Species Diversity (SISD) is based on this taxon. We explored options for sustainable farmland management by generating land-use scenarios at the regional scale. For individual bird species, high SISD scores could be reached by changing environmental variables, such as landscape or crop diversity, percent cover of spring cereals or hedge density. However, contrasting species responses to these variables prevented from reaching high scores for all species simultaneously. We were able to improve the total SISD score from 0.77 at present to 0.94 by increasing landscape and crop diversity or to 0.87 by increasing hedge density and reducing spring cereals, respectively. An economic evaluation of the return losses associated with these changes revealed that annual costs of approx. 5.5€/ha farmland would suffice for this latter increase by optimizing hedges and spring cereals towards high SISD. We conclude that balancing three levels of trade-offs, i.e. contrasting requirements of species, diverging responses in different landscapes, and alternative economic options, is difficult to achieve without systematic modelling.

These factors might interactively shape crop yield, but most studies focus on only one of these factors at a time. We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at lower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, but both scales are needed given that different processes react at different spatial scales.

Flower visitors of wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically important species.

In contrast, it remains largely unresolved how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14 wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their surrounding landscape context within a 500m radius (percentage arable land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were sampled in the early (May–June) and late (June–July) flowering season and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1%) of all 322 visiting species (<50.0% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241 non-prominent ‘other’ visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g. predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees, wildflower plantings support a high diversity of functionally complementary flower-visitor species from complex to structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where prominent providers have been lost.

However, implementing national grassland conservation policies remains challenging because their inventory, based on short-term observation, rarely discriminate semi-natural permanent from temporary grasslands. This study aims to map grassland frequency at a national scale over a long period using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m satellite time-series. A three-step method was applied to the entire area of metropolitan France (543,940 km²). First, land-use and land-cover maps—including grasslands—were produced for each year from 2006–2017 using the random forest classification of MOD13Q1 and MYD13Q1 products, which were calibrated and validated using field observations. Second, grassland frequency from 2006–2017 was calculated by combining the 12 annual maps. Third, sub-pixel analysis was performed using a reference layer with 20 m spatial resolution to quantify percentages of land-use and land-cover classes within MODIS pixels classified as grassland. Results indicate that grasslands were accurately modeled from 2006–2017 (F1-score 0.89–0.93). Nonetheless, modeling accuracy varied among biogeographical regions, with F1-score values that were very high for Continental (0.94 ± 0.01) and Atlantic (0.90 ± 0.02) regions, high for Alpine regions (0.86 ± 0.04) but moderate for Mediterranean regions (0.62 ± 0.10). The grassland frequency map for 2006–2017 at 250 m spatial resolution provides an unprecedented view of stable grassland patterns in agricultural areas compared to existing national and European GIS layers.

It currently threatens more than half of the agricultural acreage through negative changes in the whole complex of soil properties. The unfavourable consequences of surface runoff are seen in the erosion processes degrading agricultural soils. The South Moravia Region was selected as the case study area – mainly for its natural conditions and high soil degradation risk . A set of data, collected from 2012 to 2017 in a maize-growing area, especially on deep loess soils in the South Moravia Region, was used to analyse the morphological characteristics of the ephemeral gullies (EGs). The relationship was confirmed between the ephemeral gully (EG) length and the size of its contributing drainage area in accordance with studies conducted in other countries. It is also important that the closest relationship was confirmed between the length of the gully and its calculated volume. Dependence was sought on the data of 51 cases of the detailed, measured and evaluated EGs. These results will become the basis for finding a predictive relationship and the quantification of EG erosion. Locating EGs and predicting their length is crucial for estimating the sediment load and planning conservation strategies. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of this issue, i.e., define and verify the basic crucial causal factors and propose guidelines for locating the potential EG occurrence and predicting the sediment load.

These services consist of multiple and dynamic functions and are typically assessed using indicators, e.g. microbial biomass as an indicator of supporting services. Agricultural intensification negatively affects indicators of soil functions and is therefore considered to deplete soil ES. It has been suggested that incorporating leys into crop rotations can enhance soil ES. We examined this by comparing indicators of supporting soil services – organic carbon, nitrogen, water holding capacity and available phosphorous (carbon storage and nutrient retention); net nitrogen mineralisation rate and microbial biomass (nutrient cycling and retention) – in barley fields, leys and permanent pastures along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (100, 500 and 1000m radii). In addition, barley yields (provisioning service) were analysed against these indicators to identify trade-offs among soil services. Levels of most indicators did not differ between barley and ley fields and were consistently lower than in permanent pastures. Leys supported greater microbial biomass than barley fields. Landscape heterogeneity had no effect on the indicators or microbial community composition. However, landscape heterogeneity correlated negatively with yield and soil pH, suggesting that soils in heterogeneous landscapes are less fertile and therefore have lower yields. No trade-offs were found between increasing barley yield and the soil indicators.

However, the functional heterogeneity of agricultural landscapes, taking into account the different resources that habitat patches can provide to species, has rarely been studied. In this study, we explored the effect of landscape-scale nest availability provided by permanent grasslands on wild bee communities. Wild bees were sampled in 43 cereal fields in south-western France differing in the surrounding proportion of permanent grasslands. Using remote sensing tools, we measured two parameters of grassland structure known to locally influence bee nest density (slope and proportion of sparse vegetation). We found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands was the factor that most positively influenced bee richness, abundance and trait distribution in bee communities. We also found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands had a better predictive power of bee community structure than the proportion of permanent grasslands. Ground-nesting species, species with high dispersal capacities and species with a generalist diet were positively affected by the availability of sloped ground in the surrounding permanent grasslands. Only bee species with specialized flower requirements responded positively to the proportion of sparse vegetation in grasslands.

The inefficiency of the traditional methods used in obtaining this information is increasingly paving the way for Remote Sensing (RS). The Multiresolution Segmentation (MRS) algorithm is a well-known method for segmenting objects from images. The quality of segmentation depends on the a priori knowledge of which scale, shape and compactness values to use. With each parameter taking a varied range of input values, this research developed an automated approach for identifying the optimal parameter set without testing all possible combinations. At the core of our approach is Bayesian optimization, which is a sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) method for maximizing or minimizing an objective function. We maximized the Jaccard index, which is a measure that indicates the similarity between segmented agricultural objects and their corresponding reference parcels. As the optimal parameter combination varies between different agricultural landscapes, they were determined at a grid resolution of 10 km. Mono-temporal Sentinel-2 images covering Lower Saxony in Germany were tiled to these grids and the optimal parameters were subsequently identified for each tiled grid. The optimal parameter combinations identified over the grids varied considerably, which indicated that a single parameter combination would have failed to achieve optimal segmentation. We found that the quality of segmentation correlated with the size of agricultural parcels. Under-segmentation was largely minimized but in areas with a predominant agricultural land-use, it was unavoidable. In agricultural parcels composed of heterogeneous pixels, over-segmentation was prevalent. Our approach outperformed other segmentation optimization methods existing in the literature.

effective agricultural management scheme. Firstly, the LPIS does not
record all agricultural parcels especially those with large grassland
shares used for purposes like nature conservation and horse farming.
This makes it difficult to monitor those parcels. Secondly, even though
the LPIS is increasingly becoming available as open data in some EU
countries, there is still restricted access in many countries including
Germany. Thirdly, LPIS comes with a time lag, which makes in-season
monitoring of parcels infeasible. In-season monitoring is critical to understanding any emerging threats to biodiversity on agricultural
lands in near real-time so that timely action can be taken to deal with
those threats. Additionally, using LPIS requires a lot of pre-processing
effort due to different technical implementations between different
regions and countries within the EU. These drawbacks inhibit various
agricultural bodies including public institutions from making use of the
LPIS as source data for developing real-world agronomic and environ-
mental applications
- The inability of LPIS to correctly capture the different agricultural parcels
present in that area was the negative driving force behind the low OSQ.
Therefore, the low OSQ can largely be attributed to the error in LPIS
and not the segmentation.
- The most prominent spatial database of agricultural parcels within the European Union (EU)
called the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) suffers certain
drawbacks such as the inadequate coverage of all agricultural parcels,
restricted access to the data, the time lag that comes with the data, and the different implementation methods used by the different EU coun-
tries to generate the data leading to different sources of error.
- LPIS is generated based on very high-re-solution orthoimages with the spatial resolution being at least 1 m. We used Sentinel-2, which has a lower spatial resolution. With very high-
resolution orthoimages like those used to create the LPIS, our Bayesian
optimization approach can potentially be used to generate segments
with similar geometric accuracy as the LPIS.";;

We tested whether annual strips of early flowering phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia support pollinators and natural enemies of seed weevils Protapion spp., by attracting and offering nectar and pollen before the crop flowers. This was expected to increase yield of red clover Trifolium pratense seed. We monitored insect pollinators, pests, natural enemies and seed yields in a total of 50 clover fields along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, over 2 years and across two regions in southern Sweden. About half of the fields were sown with flower strips of 125–2,000 m2. The clover fields were pollinated by 60% bumble bees Bombus spp. and 40% honey bees Apis mellifera. The clover seed yield was negatively associated with weevil density, but was unrelated to bee species richness and density. Flower strips enhanced bumble bees species richness in the clover fields, with the strongest influence in heterogeneous landscapes. There were few detectable differences between crop fields with and without flower strips. However, long?tongued bumble bees were redistributed toward field interiors and during phacelia bloom honey bees toward field edges. Clover seed yield also increased with increasing size of the flower strip. We conclude that annual flower strips of early flower resources can support bumble bee species richness and, if sufficiently large, possibly also increase crop yields.

These image series are a key component of classification systems that aim at obtaining up-to-date and accurate land cover maps of the Earth’s surfaces. More specifically, current SITS combine high temporal, spectral and spatial resolutions, which makes it possible to closely monitor vegetation dynamics. Although traditional classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), have been successfully applied to create land cover maps from SITS, these algorithms do not make the most of the temporal domain. This paper proposes a comprehensive study of Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs), a deep learning approach which applies convolutions in the temporal dimension in order to automatically learn temporal (and spectral) features. The goal of this paper is to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the contribution of TempCNNs for SITS classification, as compared to RF and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) —a standard deep learning approach that is particularly suited to temporal data. We carry out experiments on Formosat-2 scene with 46 images and one million labelled time series. The experimental results show that TempCNNs are more accurate than the current state of the art for SITS classification. We provide some general guidelines on the network architecture, common regularization mechanisms, and hyper-parameter values such as batch size; we also draw out some differences with standard results in computer vision (e.g., about pooling layers).

We found that pollination success and the proportion of fully pollinated berries were higher on organic compared to conventional farms and this difference was already evident 2–4 years after conversion to organic farming.

Within the scope of this study modelling based on the approach implemented within the CROPWAT 8.0 software was applied in order to determine the irrigation requirements for an agricultural area in Gochsheim, Lower Franconia (Germany) since locally recorded data were missing, inconsistent or incomplete. The model was validated not only by available locally recorded groundwater extraction rates for agricultural irrigation purposes but also by comparison with findings from the literature. Based thereon, the annual and daily crop specific net irrigation requirements of ten commonly cultivated crops were computed – those comprised celery, lettuce, onions, potatoes, cabbage and others. The crops showed crop-specific typical annual as well as daily net irrigation requirements, e.g. celery with an annual and daily demand of 228–602 mm and 5–20 mm, respectively. Particularly important for the planning of a water reuse project was the determination of the overall daily peak gross irrigation requirement.

In a case study model calculations were used to evaluate different options of land use, agricultural and water management to reduce nitrogen immissions and enhance water and nutrient retardation in the Elbe river basin. The model scenarios consider measures which are recommended to reduce nitrogen pollution like organic farming, conversion of arable land into pasture, extensivation of grassland production and set aside. Additionally the re-wetting of formerly drained areas by water management is considered where applicable. Although there are distinct differences in nitrogen leaching between the different agricultural land use and management options, the regional effects of the scenarios on the emissions from the root zone are only fair (max. 13%) because of their limited extent of application. But the targeted application of the measures in zones of high river impact risk derived from groundwater residence times and decay calculations lead to a distinct reduction of the nitrogen input into the river flow system.

Hence, effective information regarding runoff responses to future land use scenarios provides useful support for decision-making in land use planning and management. The objective of this study is to develop a methodology to assess land use change scenario impacts on runoff at the watershed scale. This objective implies translating qualitative information from scenarios into quantitative input parameters for biophysical models. To do so, qualitative information from scenarios should be quantified and spatialized. The approach is based on the combination of 2015 local land use change scenarios (SYSPHAMM method) based on local stakeholders expertise, a model of spatio-temporal allocation of crops to fields (LandSFACTS model) and a watershed runoff model (STREAM model). The study was conducted for regions underlain by silty loamy soils scattered across Northern Europe. It was applied on the Saussay watershed in Upper Normandy (France). The approach is illustrated through runoff assessment of one of the land use change scenarios (characterized by the ending of the set-aside obligation and the disappearance of dairy farming). This scenario appeared relevant for local stakeholders. The methodology presented suggests that assessing local land use scenarios in terms of runoff requires taking into account crop allocation diversity allowed by farmers' decision rules. This requirement accounts for runoff variability at the watershed outlet since crops spatial distribution throughout the watershed, depending on farmers' specific decision rules (i.e. cropping systems), strongly condition runoff phenomenon. Besides, choices regarding scenario implementation (quantification and spatialization) should to be made according to those cropping systems. Accordingly, taking into account crop allocation diversity due to farmers' cropping systems shows that there is a variability in terms of runoff at the watershed outlet (from 19 478m3 to 35 004m3 for the winter period and a low-intensity rainfall event for example). This variability can then be explored with local decision makers with the aim of finding solutions reducing runoff risks. The proposed approach provides a useful source of information for assessing the responses of surface runoff of future land use changes.

Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered.

The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption.

VHSR Land Cover classification, in particular, is currently a well-established tool to support decisions in several domains, including urban monitoring, agriculture, biodiversity, and environmental assessment. Additionally, land cover classification can be employed to annotate VHSR imagery with the aim of retrieving spatial statistics or areas with similar land cover. Modern VHSR sensors provide data at multiple spatial and spectral resolutions, most commonly as a couple of a higher-resolution single-band panchromatic (PAN) and a coarser multispectral (MS) imagery. In the typical land cover classification workflow, the multi-resolution input is preprocessed to generate a single multispectral image at the highest resolution available by means of a pan-sharpening process. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown the advantages of avoiding data preprocessing by letting machine learning algorithms automatically transform input data to best fit the classification task. Following this rationale, we here propose a new deep learning architecture to jointly use PAN and MS imagery for a direct classification without any prior image sharpening or resampling process. Our method, namelyMultiResoLCC, consists of a two-branch end-to-end network which extracts features from each source at their native resolution and lately combine them to perform land cover classification at the PAN resolution.

The primary objective of this study was to analyse historical long-term changes of wetlands in the lowland areas of the Czech Republic, with emphasis on their spatio-temporal changes in the landscape and with stress on the use of different types of information sources. The following research questions were asked: (1) What are the wetland spatio-temporal changes (expressed through the number and size of continuously existing, extinct, and recent wetlands) and wetland change trajectories (expressed by quantifying and localising LULC categories that replaced extinct wetlands as well as categories of LULC at the expense of which wetlands occur) in the lowland landscape of the Czech Republic? (2) What methodological conclusions and recommendations for the investigation of wetland changes in a landscape can be derived from the study? The sources used for the study included historical maps from the Stable Land Registry 1841, a current orthophoto map (2015), the DIBAVOD database, LPIS [Land-Parcel Identification System] database verification, the Czech Land Registry, and field mapping (2015). Three wetland biotope types were examined: swamps and marshes, waterlogged meadows, and waterlogged woody vegetation. Spatial analysis using GIS tools (intersection, symmetrical difference) was performed to analyse the spatio-temporal wetland changes. The total wetland area has decreased dramatically from 5762ha (over 9.5% of the territory included in the study) in 1825â€“1843 to 54ha (0.9%) in 2014. Extinct wetlands predominate (99.1%) in the area, whilst recent and continuous wetlands are nearly identical (0.5% and 0.4%, respectively). A selected sample of 10 cadastral districts was used to examine the error against the DIBAVOD method and find that the error is relatively low (0.13%). The results of this study document fundamental spatio-temporal changes (expressed through change trajectories) of wetland biotopes at the landscape level in the lowland and hilly areas of the Czech Republic.

In order to understand general habitat preferences we modelled grey partridge and common pheasant densities over the entire range of Lower Saxony. Spatially explicit developments in bird densities were modelled using spatially explicit trends of crop cultivation. Pheasant and grey partridge densities counted annually by over 8000 hunting district holders over 10Â years in a range of 3.7Â MioÂ ha constitute a unique dataset (wildlife survey of Lower Saxony). Data on main landscape groups, functional groups of agricultural crops (consisting of 9.5 million fields compiled by the Integrated Administration and Control System) and landscape features were aggregated to 420 municipalities. To model linear 8 or 10Â year population trends (for common pheasant and grey partridge respectively) we use rho correlation coefficients of densities, but also rho coefficients of agricultural crops. RESULTS: All models confirm a dramatic decline in population densities. The habitat model for the grey partridge shows avoidance of municipalities with a high proportion of woodland and water areas, but a preference for areas with a high proportion of winter grains and high crop diversity. The trend model confirms these findings with a linear positive effect of diversity on grey partridge population development. Similarly, the pheasant avoids wooded areas but showed some preference for municipalities with open water. The effect of maize was found to be positive at medium densities, but negative at very high proportions. Winter grains, landscape features and high crop diversity are favorable. The positive effect of winter grains and higher crop diversity is also supported by the trend model. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the strong importance of diverse crop cultivation. Most incentives favor the cultivation of specific crops, which results in large areas of monocultures. The results confirm the importance of sustainable agricultural policies.;;2005-2014;yes;major;"GSAA (agricultural parcel; plot)";"In this paper we modelled both the habitat preferences

In this study, we aimed to understand how agricultural land use affects a number of different traits in ground beetle communities to better predict potential consequences of land-use change for ecosystem functioning. We studied ground beetles in fields with different agricultural land use ranging from frequently managed sugar beet fields, winter wheat fields to less intensively managed grasslands. The ground beetles were collected in emergence tents that catch individuals overwintering locally in different life stages and with pitfall traps that catch individuals that could have a local origin or may have dispersed into the field. Community weighted mean values for ground beetle traits such as body size, flight ability and feeding preference were estimated for each land-use type and sampling method. In fields with high land-use intensity the average body length of emerging ground beetle communities was lower than in the grasslands while the average body length of actively moving communities did not differ between the land-use types. The proportion of ground beetles with good flight ability or a carnivorous diet was higher in the crop fields as compared to the grasslands. Our study highlights that increasing management intensity reduces the average body size of emerging ground beetles and the proportion of mixed feeders. Our results also suggest that the dispersal ability of ground beetles enables them to compensate for local management intensities.;;2010;yes;major;"GSAA (agricultural parcel; plot)";we aimed to understand how agricultural land use affects a number of different traits in ground beetle communities to better predict potential consequences of land-use change for ecosystem functioning;"selector variable, grouping variable (?

Earlier studies have focused on how loss of foraging resources affects colony growth and thereby abundance of workers and sexual reproduction. By comparing bumblebees in agricultural landscapes of different complexity in Southern Sweden, we here demonstrate that also the adult size of bumblebee foragers is significantly related to the availability of foraging resources. This effect was independent of both species identity and foraging habitat type. This suggests a shortage of flower resources in landscapes of lower complexity, which may also affect the reproductive success of colonies negatively. Zusammenfassung Es wird angenommen, dass der negative Einfluss der landwirtschaftlichen Intensivierung auf Hummelpopulationen teilweise durch einen Verlust an Nahrungspflanzen hervorgerufen wird, beispielsweise wegen höherer Feldgrößen und dem damit verbundenen Verlust an Feldrändern und ihren Nektar- und Pollenpflanzen. Frühere Untersuchungen haben sich darauf konzentriert, wie der Verlust von Nahrungspflanzen das Koloniewachstum und damit Arbeiterabundanz und sexuelle Reproduktion beeinflusst. Indem wir Hummeln in südschwedischen Agrarlandschaften von unterschiedlicher Komplexität miteinander verglichen, zeigen wir, dass auch die Körpergröße von Hummelarbeiterinnen signifikant mit der Verfügbarkeit von Ressourcen verbunden ist. Dieser Effekt war unabhängig von der Artzugehörigkeit und dem Typ des Nahrungshabitats.

The ES matrix method is a commonly used approach as it allows for a comparably fast, comprehensible and accessible ES assessment. As it is often based on land use/land cover data (LULC) with no spatial variability, a main critique is that the results fail to assess spatial variability at landscape levels, which limits the reliability of the outputs for spatial planning applications. By using the case study area of Bornhöved in northern Germany, we analyzed three assessment methods that combine expert judgments, LULC data with different resolutions and ecosystem condition indicators, in order to find the required resolution and data for ES assessment and mapping at a local scale. To quantify map discrepancies, we used the structural similarity index (SSIM) and analyzed the differences in local mean, variance and covariance between the maps. We found that using different spatial resolutions led to a relatively small difference in the outcomes, in which regulation and maintenance services are more affected than the other services categories.

Nodes were the 3,159,787 pastures reported in 2010 by the French breeders to claim the Common Agricultural Policy subsidies. Links connected pastures when the distance between them was below a predefined threshold. Premises networks were obtained by aggregating into a single node all the pastures under the same ownership. Although the pastures network was very fragmented when the distance threshold was short (1.5 meters, relevant for a directly-transmitted disease), it was not the case when the distance threshold was larger (500 m, relevant for a vector-borne disease: 97% of the nodes in the largest connected component). The premises network was highly connected as the largest connected component always included more than 83% of the nodes, whatever the distance threshold. Percolation analyses were performed to model the population-level efficacy of biosecurity measures. Percolation thresholds varied according to the modelled biosecurity measures and to the distance threshold.

New plantations tend to spread in southern areas; willow tends to be planted on higher productivity agricultural areas, and poplar on less productive land. There is a trend towards preferring smaller plantations (<1 ha) versus large ones (>10 ha).

That is, it has been an open question whether agricultural intensity and landscape simplicity should be regarded as one single or as two separate dimensions. To evaluate this we analysed landscape data in 136 different 1km×1km study sites and within a buffer zone of 2km around each site (i.e. approximately 5km×5km). The sites were distributed over a large part of the region of Scania, southernmost Sweden, an area dominated by agriculture but with large variation in both intensity and complexity. We used spatially explicit digital data on land use, digitised aerial photographs, field surveys of landscape elements and agricultural statistics. Two separate factor analyses, one for each scale of measurements (1km and 5km), suggest that there are five and three relevant factors for each scale respectively. At the 1km scale, the first factor can be interpreted as describing the intensity of land use in the form of proportion arable land which is highly correlated to crop yield. The second and third factors are more connected to landscape structure and amount of small patches of semi-natural habitats. The fourth and fifth factors contain one major variable each: proportion pasture and leys respectively. The division of intensity and complexity related variables is less clear at a larger spatial scale. At the 5km scale, factor 1 is defined almost identically as at the 1km scale. However, factors 2 and 3 are interpreted as descriptors of dairy and livestock farming systems but also include structural variables.

Climate change is an existential threat to farmers and current patterns of arable agriculture, leading to increases in the variability of agricultural productivity and crop failure. The performance of many of the crops that are currently highly productive will decline significantly and the geographical envelopes within which these crops can be grown are expected to shift northwards in Europe. Farmers will likely be faced with a choice: either leave farming or modify the crops that are grown, adopting new cultivars or species able to be cultivated profitably under future climatic conditions. We hypothesised that farmers do not adopt new crops or cultivars individually but use crops within sequences, called rotations, which are agronomically well understood. We know from past research that changes to rotations will lead to changes in biodiversity and the ecosystem services furnished by farmland, both within a field and at landscape scales. Here, we show how we might: use farmer knowledge of crop agronomy to propose future crop rotations in the light of climate change predictions; model these crop rotations to estimate likely effects on economy, biodiversity and ecosystem services; and validate these predictions through empirical study in regions where the rotations are already used. A workflow of co-development would have the benefit of generating practical rotations built on farmer knowledge and demonstrate empirically the predicted economic and ecological effects, markedly increasing the likely credibility of the results for farmers.

However, it is a methodological challenge to provide fine-resolution analyses at the scale of large watersheds used for crises management. In this study, we present a methodology based on multiple methods and mixed sources of information to finely model an agricultural landscape (AL) that represents the spatial distribution of cropping systems. Our approach is based on progressively hybridizing databases and local actors' and experts' knowledge to produce a spatially explicit and dynamic model. The Land Parcel Identification System database, which resulted from the European Common Agricultural Policy, is crucial for our method since it provides the spatial and temporal basis of our model (i.e., geographic delineation of islets and information about crop sequences). Local knowledge is used to identify factors determining spatial distribution of cropping systems and to build a generic model that simulates farmers' crop-management strategies. The model was qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using a multi-agent simulation platform (MAELIA). We asked local experts on quantitative water management to evaluate the ability of the platform to reproduce intra- and inter-annual dynamics at different levels when using our model of the AL as input. The experts were satisfied with the results; they validated the predicted dynamics of the variables, and some discussed the objectivity of the values.

The use of time series phenology can help overcome limitations of conventional classification-based mapping approaches encountered when, for example, attempting to characterize grassland use intensity. In Europe, permanent grasslands account for more than one third of all agricultural land and a considerable share of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget is devoted to grasslands. The frequency and timing of mowing events is an important proxy for grassland use intensity and methods that allow characterizing grassland use intensity at the parcel level and over large areas are urgently needed. Here we present a novel algorithm that allows detecting and quantifying the number and timing of mowing events in central European grasslands. The algorithm utilizes all imagery acquired by Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI for one entire year as available from the NASA Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel dataset. Cloud-free observations from both sensors are first synthesized through compositing at 10-day interval. Machine learning algorithms are then used to derive a grassland stratum. The intra-annual growing season profiles of NDVI values are subsequently assessed and compared to an idealized growing season trajectory. Residuals between the idealized trajectory and a polynomial model fit to the observed NDVI values are then evaluated to detect potential mowing events. We demonstrate and evaluate the performance of our algorithm and utilize its large area analysis capabilities by mapping the frequency and timing of grassland mowing events in 2016 on the national-scale across Germany. Our results suggest that 25% of the grassland area is not used for mowing. Validation results however suggest a relatively high omission error of the algorithm for areas that only experienced a single mowing event. The date ranges of detected mowing events compare overall well to a sample of interpreted time series points and to farm level reports on mowing dates.

They are biological and biogeochemical hotspots. Due to small size, small perimeter and shallow depth biological and biogeochemical processes in kettle holes are closely linked to the dynamics and the emissions of the terrestrial environment. On the other hand, their intriguing high spatial and temporal variability makes a sound understanding of the terrestrial-aquatic link very difficult. It is presumed that intensive agricultural land use during the last decades has resulted in a ubiquitous high nutrient load. However, the water quality encountered at single sites highly depends on internal biogeochemical processes and thus can differ substantially even between adjacent sites. This study aimed at elucidating the interplay between external drivers and internal processes based on a thorough analysis of a comprehensive kettle hole water quality data set. To study the role of external drivers, effects of land use in the adjacent terrestrial environment, effects of vegetation at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic systems, and that of kettle hole morphology on water quality was investigated. None of these drivers was prone to strong with-in year variability. Thus temporal variability of spatial patterns could point to the role of internal biogeochemical processes. To that end, the temporal stability of the respective spatial patterns was studied as well for various solutes. All of these analyses were performed for a set of different variables. Different results for different solutes were then used as a source of information about the respective driving processes. In the Quillow catchment in the Uckermark region, about 100km north of Berlin, Germany, 62 kettle holes have been regularly sampled since 2013. Kettle hole catchments were determined based on a groundwater level map of the uppermost aquifer. The catchments were not clearly related to topography. Spatial patterns of kettle hole water concentration of (earth) alkaline metals and chloride were fairly stable, presumably reflecting solute concentration of the uppermost aquifer. In contrast, spatial patterns of nutrients and redox-sensitive solutes within the kettle holes were hardly correlated between different sampling campaigns. Correspondingly, effects of season, hydrogeomorphic kettle hole type, shore vegetation or land use in the respective catchments were significant but explained only a minor portion of the total variance. It is concluded that internal processes mask effects of the terrestrial environment. There is some evidence that denitrification and phosphorus release from the sediment during frequent periods of hypoxia might play a major role.

Significant differences of kettle hole water quality parameters between different land use classes with respect to close vicinity to the kettle holes (left panel). ;Land use in the respective catchment was determined using the InVeKoS data set, the anonymised GIS data (field sketches) of the Federal State of Brandenburg for application for subsidies. The centre of each raster cell of the catchments was assigned the crop that had been harvested in the respective year of sampling. Land use effects on kettle hole water quality were assessed following two different approaches. Firstly, information about the crop grown in direct proximity of the kettle holes in the respective sampling year was extracted from the InVeKoS data base.

National and global emission inventories are known to have difficulty representing the large spatial and temporal variability inherent to atmospheric NH3. In this study, we compare NH3 emissions in France during spring 2011 from one reference inventory, the TNO inventory, and two alternative inventories that account in different manners for both the spatial and temporal variabilities of the emissions: (i) the NH3SAT satellite-derived inventory based on IASI NH3 columns and (ii) the CADASTRE-CIT inventory that combinesNH3 emissions due to nitrogen fertilization calculated with the mechanistic model VOLT'AIR on the database of the CADASTRE_NH3 framework and other source emissions from the CITEPA. The total spring budgets, from March to May 2011, at the national level are higher when calculated with both alternative inventories than with the reference, the difference being more marked with CADASTRE-CIT. NH3SAT and CADASTRE-CIT inventories both yield to large NH3 spring emissions due to fertilization on soils with high pH in the northeastern part of France (65 and 135 ktNH3, respectively, vs. 48 ktNH3 for TNO-GEN), while soil properties are not accounted for by the TNO-GEN methodology. For the other parts of France, the differences are smaller. The timing of fertilization and associated ammonia emissions is closely related to the nitrogen requirements and hence the phenological stage of the crops, and therefore to the crop year's specific weather conditions. Maximum emissions are observed in March for 2011 for some regions for both alternative inventories, while April is the period with maximum emissions for the reference inventory regardless of the region or the year. Comparing the inventories at finer temporal resolutions, typically at daily scale, large differences are found. The convergence of alternative, independent and complementary methods on the spatiotemporal representation of the spring NH3 emissions, particularly over areas where the contribution of mineral fertilizer spreading to the spring budget is strong, encourages further developments in both prospective complementary directions, as this will help improve national NH3 emission inventories.;no;2010-2011;yes;major;"GSAA (agricultural parcel; plot)";This study aims at assessing the potential contribution of better spatial and temporal representation of fertilization-related ammonia emissions to the quality of ammonia emission inventories. … we compare ammonia emissions in France from inventories using the different approaches;"CADASTRE_NH3 was implemented in order to represent in a realistic way spatiotemporal variability of French NH3 emissions due to mineral and organic N fertilization and is fully described in Ramanantenasoa et al.
